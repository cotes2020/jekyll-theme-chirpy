To monitor VMs in Azure means collecting and analyzing different metrics as well as collection log data from system log files and from applications running within the VMs. It is possible to configure an email alert to an administrator which is triggered when certain criteria regarding these metrics are met. Monitoring helps you to gain insight into the status of the VMs.

Windows and Linux VMs collect the following metrics out of the box:

  * CPU percentage
  * Disk read and write in KB/s or MB/s
  * Network in and out in KB/s or MB/s

On Windows, the Azure Virtual Machine Agent installs the IaaSDiagnostics extension which monitors and collects diagnostic data. On Linux the Microsoft.Insights.VMDaignsticsSettings extension provides the same function.

The metrics collected on a Linux VM are:

  * CPU
  * Disk
  * Memory
  * Network
  * Packets
  * Page
  * Swap

The metrics collected on a Windows VM are:

  * CPU
  * Disk
  * Network
  * Memory
  * ASP.NET
  * SQL Server

These metrics are stored in Azure Storage Tables. By default, all metrics are collected every minute as a new row in the table.

<span class="fontstyle0">For Windows VMs, metric data is written to the WADPerformanceCountersTable, with aggregates of these performance counter metrics aggregated to the minute or to the hour written to tables that start with the name WADMetricsPT1M for by minute and WADMetricsPT1H for by hour.  In addition to metrics, system logs are also collected. For Linux VM’s, the Syslog is collected into the LinuxsyslogVer2v0 table. For Windows VMs, all event log entries for the three event logs (application, security and system logs) are written to the WADWindowsEventLogsTable.</span>

<span class="fontstyle0">Windows VMs can collect other types of logs. Diagnostic infrastructure logs (events generated by the Azure Diagnostic Agent, such as issues collecting metrics) are written to the WADDiagnosticInfrastructureLogsTable, and application logs (the trace output from your .NET  application running in the VM) are stored in the WADLogsTable. Windows VMs can also collect Event Tracing for Windows Events. These events are collected into the WADETWEventTable.

## Configure monitoring and diagnostics for a new VM

To enable monitoring and diagnostics when deploying a new VM follow these steps:

  1. Go to the Marketplace, select Compute, then Windows Server, select the desired Version, for example, 2016. After selecting your OS click Create.
  2. Provide the following information for your VM: 
      * Name
      * Disk type (SSD or HDD)
      * User name
      * Password
      * Subscription
      * An existing or new Resource group
      * Location
      * License (if available)

## Configure monitoring and diagnostics for an existing VM

To enable monitoring and diagnostics for an existing VM follow these steps:

  1. Go to your VM in the Azure Portal.
  2. Under the Monitoring section, select Diagnostics settings.
  3. For Linux VMs, toggle the Status to On to enable diagnostics.
  4. For Windows, you have more options 
      1. On the Overview tab, select Enable guest-level monitoring.
      2. Check the categories you want to log on the Performance counters tab. Additionally, you can set the sample rate in seconds.
      3.  On the Logs tab, you can configure what events the different logs (Application, Security, System, and IIS) log.
      4. On the Crash dumps tap, you can enable collecting memory dumps during a crash.
      5. To enable the collection diagnostic infrastructure logs, tootle Diagnostic infrastructure logs to Enabled on the Agent tab. Then select the desired log level.
  5. After all settings are made, select Save.

## Configure Alerts

Azure enables you to configure alert rules based on the collected metrics of your VM. These alerts can be sending an email, invoking a Webhook or run a Logic App. Additionally, it is possible to send an email, an SMS or a Webhook when a specific log event is encountered.

### Enable alerts

To enable and configure alerts follow these steps:

  1. Navigate to your VM in the Azure Portal.
  2. Under the Monitoring menu, select Alert rules.
  3. Click + Add metric alert or + Add activity log alert to add a new rule.
  4. On the Add rule provide a name, select the metric source, specify the condition and then select the action to take when this condition is met.

## Monitor metrics

You can assess the status and health of your VM by viewing its metrics in the portal, by querying the table storage for diagnostic logs or by downloading the IIS logs from Azure Storage.

To look at the metrics follow these steps:

  1. Navigate to your VM in the Azure Portal.
  2. Select Metrics under the Monitoring menu.
  3. On the Metrics blade, select the metrics you want to view. The selected metrics will be displayed as a graph on the right side.

  1. Go to your Log Analytics in the Azure Portal.
  2. Select Virtual machines under the Workspace Data Sources menu and select the VM you want to install the agent on.
  3. On the Virtual machine blade, click on Connect. This installs the agent and configures it for your Log Analytics workspace.
  4. After the installation is completed, the OMS connection status will change to This workspace.

  1. Go to Log Analytics in the Azure Portal.
  2. Select Advanced settings under the Settings menu.
  3. Select Data and then select Windows Event Logs.
  4. Add a new event log by entering a name and then clicking +.
  5. After the log is created, select the desired log level.

### View the collected data

After data collection is set up, you can run searches in your log. To do that, follow these steps:

  1. Open your Log Analytics in the Azure Portal.
  2. Click Log Search under the General menu.
  3. The Log Search blade already suggests a couple of queries and the search box also makes suggestions based on your input. For example, you could enter Usage and click the Search icon which will give you various information about the usage of your VM.

### Monitor your network topology

After you deployed your Network Watcher, you can look at the topology of your network by following these steps:

  1. Click on Topology under the Monitoring menu.
  2. On the Topology blade select your Subscription, Resource group, and Virtual Network.
  3. Your network will be displayed you can download it by clicking on Download topology

## Monitor your network

To monitor and diagnose your network, Azure has a service called Network Watcher. The Network Watcher can visualize your network and therefore can help you to understand, diagnose and gain insights into your network in Azure. Following, I will talk about some features of the Network Watcher.

### Create a Network Watcher

To enable a Network Watcher follow these steps:

  1. In the Azure Portal, click on All services and search for Network Watcher and select the result.
  2. On the Overview blade of your Network Watcher, enable the regions you want to monitor in the drop-down list.

<div id="attachment_964" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

  </p>
</div>

### Monitor the topology of your network

After your Network Watcher is deployed, you can take a look at the topology of your network. To do that follow these steps:

  1. In your Network Watcher, click on Topology under the Monitoring menu.
  2. On the Topology blade, select a Subscription, Resource Group, and a Virtual Network.
  3. After a couple of seconds, your network will be displayed. You can also download the topology by clicking on Download topology.

  </p>
</div>

### Monitor your network limits

You can only have a certain amount of network resources per subscription. The Network Watcher lists all used resources and makes it easy to monitor them. To do that follow these steps:

  1. In your Network Watcher, click on Network subscription limit.
  2. Select a Subscription and Location.
