I recently read a 1977 article about the dawn of personal computers and their promises, such as home automation and business applications. That made me think about the Tech Crunch article <a  target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/the-no-code-generation-is-arriving/">The-Code Generation is Arriving</a> by Danny Crichton, which talks about no coding needed in today’s technology world. The code to generate code was possibly an afterthought in the past. Then came object-oriented programming, efficient computing algorithms, design patterns, and deep learning. The past generations have set the technology up so beautifully for Generation Y in their thirties today, followed by Generation Z in their early twenties and younger. Now it is all about code through no code. What a fascinating world of technology we live in today.
