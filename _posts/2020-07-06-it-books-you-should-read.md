Nowadays there are a million ways for developers to learn new technologies or principles, like Pluralsight, Youtube, blogs or books. I like to read books when I commute or during cardio in the gym. In this post, I will present all books I have read in the last couple of years and provide some basic information. I will separate them in IT books and non IT books. The books are in no particular order, except The Phoenix Project and The Unicorn Project were the books I enjoyed most.

## IT Books

### <a href="https://amzn.to/2NWaXSL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Phoenix Project<span id="productTitle" class="a-size-extra-large">: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win</span></a>

Bill is an IT manager at Parts Unlimited. It&#8217;s Tuesday morning and on his drive into the office, Bill gets a call from the CEO.

The company&#8217;s new IT initiative, code named Phoenix Project, is critical to the future of Parts Unlimited, but the project is massively over budget and very late. The CEO wants Bill to report directly to him and fix the mess in ninety days or else Bill&#8217;s entire department will be outsourced.

With the help of a prospective board member and his mysterious philosophy of The Three Ways, Bill starts to see that IT work has more in common with manufacturing plant work than he ever imagined. With the clock ticking, Bill must organize work flow streamline interdepartmental communications, and effectively serve the other business functions at Parts Unlimited.

In a fast-paced and entertaining style, three luminaries of the DevOps movement deliver a story that anyone who works in IT will recognize. Readers will not only learn how to improve their own IT organizations, they&#8217;ll never view IT the same way again.

### <a href="https://amzn.to/3e4YOFu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Unicorn Project<span id="productTitle" class="a-size-extra-large">: A Novel about Developers, Digital Disruption, and Thriving in the Age of Data</span></a>

_The Unicorn Project,_ we follow Maxine, a senior lead developer and architect, as she is exiled to the Phoenix Project, to the horror of her friends and colleagues, as punishment for contributing to a payroll outage. She tries to survive in what feels like a heartless and uncaring bureaucracy and to work within a system where no one can get anything done without endless committees, paperwork, and approvals.

The Age of Software is here, and another mass extinction event looms—this is a story about rebel developers and business leaders working together, racing against time to innovate, survive, and thrive in a time of unprecedented uncertainty…and opportunity.

### <a href="https://amzn.to/3e3L2TB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clean Code<span id="productTitle" class="a-size-extra-large">: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</span></a>

Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.

Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with _**Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship** _. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer—but only if you work at it.

What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code—lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.

_**Clean Code** _is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.

**Readers will come away from this book understanding:**

  * How to tell the difference between good and bad code
  * How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code
  * How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes
  * How to format code for maximum readability
  * How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic
  * How to unit test and practice test-driven development

This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.

### <a href="https://amzn.to/2O0KP9i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Clean Coder<span id="productTitle" class="a-size-extra-large">: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers</span></a>

Programmers who endure and succeed amidst swirling uncertainty and nonstop pressure share a common attribute: They care deeply about the practice of creating software. They treat it as a craft. They are professionals.

In _**The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers,** _legendary software expert Robert C. Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software craftsmanship. This book is packed with practical advice–about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act.

**Readers will learn:**

  * What it means to behave as a true software craftsman
  * How to deal with conflict, tight schedules, and unreasonable managers
  * How to get into the flow of coding, and get past writer’s block
  * How to handle unrelenting pressure and avoid burnout
  * How to combine enduring attitudes with new development paradigms
  * How to manage your time, and avoid blind alleys, marshes, bogs, and swamps
  * How to foster environments where programmers and teams can thrive
  * When to say “No”–and how to say it
  * When to say “Yes”–and what yes really means

Great software is something to marvel at: powerful, elegant, functional, a pleasure to work with as both a developer and as a user. Great software isn’t written by machines. It is written by professionals with an unshakable commitment to craftsmanship. **_The Clean Coder_ **will help you become one of them–and earn the pride and fulfillment that they alone possess.

### <a href="https://amzn.to/2ACNaEm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloud Computing &#8211; Concepts, Technology & Architecture</a>

Clouds are distributed technology platforms that leverage sophisticated technology innovations to provide highly scalable and resilient environments that can be remotely utilized by organizations in a multitude of powerful ways. To successfully build upon, integrate with, or even create a cloud environment requires an understanding of its common inner mechanics, architectural layers, and models, as well as an understanding of the business and economic factors that result from the adoption and real-world use of cloud-based services.

In _Cloud Computing: Concepts, Technology & Architecture_, Thomas Erl, one of the world’s top-selling IT authors, teams up with cloud computing experts and researchers to break down proven and mature cloud computing technologies and practices into a series of well-defined concepts, models, technology mechanisms, and technology architectures, all from an industry-centric and vendor-neutral point of view. In doing so, the book establishes concrete, academic coverage with a focus on structure, clarity, and well-defined building blocks for mainstream cloud computing platforms and solutions.

Subsequent to technology-centric coverage, the book proceeds to establish business-centric models and metrics that allow for the financial assessment of cloud-based IT resources and their comparison to those hosted on traditional IT enterprise premises. Also provided are templates and formulas for calculating SLA-related quality-of-service values and numerous explorations of the SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS delivery models.

With more than 260 figures, 29 architectural models, and 20 mechanisms, this indispensable guide provides a comprehensive education of cloud computing essentials that will never leave your side.

### <a href="https://amzn.to/3iD9u1B" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starting and Scaling DevOps in the Enterprise</a>

DevOps is a fundamental shift in how leading edge companies are starting to manage their software and IT work. Businesses need to move more quickly than ever before, and large software organizations are applying these DevOps principles to develop new software faster than anyone previously thought possible. DevOps started in small organizations and in large organizations that had or created architectures that enabled small teams to independently develop, qualify, and deploy code. The impact on productivity is so dramatic that larger organizations with tightly coupled architectures are realizing they either need to embrace DevOps or be left behind.

The biggest challenge is that they can’t just empower small teams to work independently because their legacy architectures require coordinating the development, qualification, and deployment of code across hundreds of people. They need a DevOps approach that not only addresses their unique challenges, but also helps them reach an organization-wide agreement on where to start and how to scale DevOps. That is where Starting and Scaling DevOps in the Enterprise comes in. Starting and Scaling DevOps in the Enterprise is a quick, easy-to-read guide that helps structure those improvements by providing a framework that large organizations can use to understand DevOps principles in the context of their current development processes and gain alignment across the organization for successful implementations.

The book illustrates how to analyze your current development and delivery processes to ensure you gain positive momentum by implementing the DevOps practices that will have the greatest immediate impact on the productivity of your organization, with the goal of achieving continuous improvement over time.

**Who This Book Is For**

Those involved with software development such as test automation leads, QA managers, test automation developers, and development managers. Some parts of the book assume hands-on experience in writing code in an object-oriented language (mainly C# or Java), although most of the content is also relevant for non-programmers.

### <a href="https://amzn.to/2Z3GY1n" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test-Driven Development</a>

Quite simply, test-driven development is meant to eliminate fear in application development. While some fear is healthy (often viewed as a conscience that tells programmers to &#8220;be careful!&#8221;), the author believes that byproducts of fear include tentative, grumpy, and uncommunicative programmers who are unable to absorb constructive criticism. When programming teams buy into TDD, they immediately see positive results. They eliminate the fear involved in their jobs, and are better equipped to tackle the difficult challenges that face them.

TDD eliminates tentative traits, it teaches programmers to communicate, and it encourages team members to seek out criticism However, even the author admits that grumpiness must be worked out individually! In short, the premise behind TDD is that code should be continually tested and refactored. Kent Beck teaches programmers by example, so they can painlessly and dramatically increase the quality of their work.

</h3>

When General Stanley McChrystal took command of the Joint Special Operations Task Force in 2004, he quickly realized that conventional military tactics were failing. Al Qaeda in Iraq was a decentralized network that could move quickly, strike ruthlessly, then seemingly vanish into the local population. The allied forces had a huge advantage in numbers, equipment, and training—but none of that seemed to matter. To defeat Al Qaeda, they would have to combine the power of the world’s mightiest military with the agility of the world’s most fearsome terrorist network. They would have to become a &#8220;team of teams&#8221;—faster, flatter, and more flexible than ever.

In _Team of Teams_, McChrystal and his colleagues show how the challenges they faced in Iraq can be rel­evant to countless businesses, nonprofits, and or­ganizations today. In periods of unprecedented crisis, leaders need practical management practices that can scale to thousands of people—and fast. By giving small groups the freedom to experiment and share what they learn across the entire organiza­tion, teams can respond more quickly, communicate more freely, and make better and faster decisions.

Drawing on compelling examples—from NASA to hospital emergency rooms—_Team of Teams_ makes the case for merging the power of a large corporation with the agility of a small team to transform any organization.

_Creativity, Inc._ is a manual for anyone who strives for originality and the first-ever, all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animation—into the meetings, postmortems, and “Braintrust” sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is, at heart, a book about creativity—but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.”

For nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the _Toy Story_ trilogy, _Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, WALL-E, _and _Inside Out, _which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really _is_. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired—and so profitable.

As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his co-founding Pixar in 1986. Nine years later, _Toy Story_ was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie’s success—and in the thirteen movies that followed—was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on leadership and management philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as:

  * Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better.
  * If you don’t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead.
  * It’s not the manager’s job to prevent risks. It’s the manager’s job to make it safe for others to take them.
  * The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them.
  * A company’s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody.

Has the &#8220;settle-for-less&#8221; financial plan become your plan for wealth? That sounds something like this:

**_Graduate from college, get a good job, save 10% of your paycheck, buy a used car, cancel the movie channels, quit drinking expensive Starbucks mocha lattes, save and penny-pinch your life away, trust your life-savings to Wall Street, and one day, when you are oh, say, 65 years old, you can retire rich._**

Since you were old enough to hold a job, you&#8217;ve been hoodwinked to believe that wealth can be created by blindly trusting in the uncontrollable and unpredictable markets: the housing market, the stock market, and the job market. This soul-sucking, dream-stealing dogma is &#8220;The Slowlane&#8221; &#8211; an impotent FINANCIAL GAMBLE that dubiously promises wealth in a wheelchair.

Accept the Slowlane as your financial roadmap and your financial future will blow carelessly asunder on a sailboat of HOPE: HOPE you can get a job and keep it, HOPE the stock market doesn&#8217;t tank, HOPE for a robust economy, HOPE, HOPE, and HOPE. Is HOPE really the centerpiece of your family&#8217;s financial plan?

Drive the Slowlane and you will find your life deteriorate into a miserable exhibition about what you cannot do, versus what you can. For those who don&#8217;t want a lifetime subscription to mediocrity, there is an alternative; an expressway to extraordinary wealth capable of burning a trail to financial freedom faster than any road out there. And shockingly, this road has nothing to do with jobs, 401(k), mutual funds, or a lifestyle of miserly living and 190 square foot tiny houses. Just some of what you will learn:

  * Why jobs, 401(k)s, mutual funds, and 40-years of mindless frugality will never make you rich young.
  * Why most entrepreneurs fail and how to immediately put the odds in your favor.
  * The real law of wealth: Leverage this and wealth has no choice but to be magnetized to you.
  * The leading cause of poorness: Change this and you change everything.
  * How the rich really get rich &#8211; and no, it has nothing to do with a paycheck or a 401K match.
  * The mathematics of wealth and how any &#8220;Joe Schmo&#8221; can tap into real wealth real fast.
  * Why the guru&#8217;s sacred deities &#8211; compound interest and indexed funds &#8211; are impotent wealth accelerators.
  * Why popular guru platitudes like &#8220;do what you love&#8221; and &#8220;follow your passion&#8221; will most likely keep you poor, not rich.
  * And 250+ more poverty busting distinctions&#8230;

Demand more. Change lanes and find your explosive wealth accelerator. Hit the Fastlane, crack the code to wealth, and find out how to live rich for a lifetime.

**What is _Violent _Communication?**

**If “violent” means acting in ways that result in hurt or harm, then much ****of how we communicate**—judging others, bullying, having racial bias, blaming, finger pointing, discriminating, speaking without listening, criticizing others or ourselves, name-calling, reacting when angry, using political rhetoric, being defensive or judging who’s “good/bad” or what’s “right/wrong” with people—**could indeed be called “violent communication.”**  
**What is _Nonviolent _Communication?**

**Nonviolent Communication is the integration of four things:**  
****

  * **Consciousness:** a set of principles that support living a life of compassion, collaboration, courage, and authenticity<7li>
  * **Language:** understanding how words contribute to connection or distance
  * **Communication:** knowing how to ask for what we want, how to hear others even in disagreement, and how to move toward solutions that work for all
  * **Means of influence:** sharing “power with others” rather than using “power over others”
  * **Nonviolent Communication serves our desire to do three things:**
  * **Increase our ability to live with choice, meaning, and connection**
  * **Connect empathically with self and others to have more satisfying** **relationships**
  * **Sharing of resources so everyone is able to benefit**
