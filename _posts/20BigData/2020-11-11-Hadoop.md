- Apache Hadoop
  - an open source framework for big data. 
  - It is based on the <font color=red> MapReduce programming model </font> which Google invented and published.  
    - <font color=red> "Map function" </font> 
      - runs in parallel with a massive dataset to produce intermediate results. 
    - <font color=red> "Reduce function" </font> 
      - builds a final result set based on all those intermediate results. 
  - The term "Hadoop" is often used informally to encompass Apache Hadoop itself, and related projects such as Apache Spark, Apache Pig, and Apache Hive.
