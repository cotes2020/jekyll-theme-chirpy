assign_ipv6_addresses(kwargs_)

Assigns one or more IPv6 addresses to the specified network interface. You can specify one or more specific IPv6 addresses, or you can specify the number of IPv6 addresses to be automatically assigned from within the subnet's IPv6 CIDR block range. You can assign as many IPv6 addresses to a network interface as you can assign private IPv4 addresses, and the limit varies per instance type. For information, see [IP Addresses Per Network Interface Per Instance Type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html#AvailableIpPerENI) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

You must specify either the IPv6 addresses or the IPv6 address count in the request.

**Request Syntax**

response = client.assign_ipv6_addresses(
    Ipv6AddressCount=123,
    Ipv6Addresses=[
        'string',
    ],
    NetworkInterfaceId='string'
)

Parameters

*   **Ipv6AddressCount** (_integer_) -- The number of IPv6 addresses to assign to the network interface. Amazon EC2 automatically selects the IPv6 addresses from the subnet range. You can't use this option if specifying specific IPv6 addresses.
*   **Ipv6Addresses** (_list_) --

    One or more specific IPv6 addresses to be assigned to the network interface. You can't use this option if you're specifying a number of IPv6 addresses.

    *   _(string) --_
*   **NetworkInterfaceId** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The ID of the network interface.


Return type

dict

Returns

**Response Syntax**

{
    'AssignedIpv6Addresses': [
        'string',
    ],
    'NetworkInterfaceId': 'string'
}

**Response Structure**

*   _(dict) --_

    *   **AssignedIpv6Addresses** _(list) --_

        The IPv6 addresses assigned to the network interface.

        *   _(string) --_
    *   **NetworkInterfaceId** _(string) --_

        The ID of the network interface.


assign_private_ip_addresses(kwargs_)

Assigns one or more secondary private IP addresses to the specified network interface.

You can specify one or more specific secondary IP addresses, or you can specify the number of secondary IP addresses to be automatically assigned within the subnet's CIDR block range. The number of secondary IP addresses that you can assign to an instance varies by instance type. For information about instance types, see [Instance Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ . For more information about Elastic IP addresses, see [Elastic IP Addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

When you move a secondary private IP address to another network interface, any Elastic IP address that is associated with the IP address is also moved.

Remapping an IP address is an asynchronous operation. When you move an IP address from one network interface to another, check network/interfaces/macs/mac/local-ipv4s in the instance metadata to confirm that the remapping is complete.

You must specify either the IP addresses or the IP address count in the request.

associate_address(kwargs_)

Associates an Elastic IP address, or carrier IP address (for instances that are in subnets in Wavelength Zones) with an instance or a network interface. Before you can use an Elastic IP address, you must allocate it to your account.

An Elastic IP address is for use in either the EC2-Classic platform or in a VPC. For more information, see [Elastic IP Addresses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

[EC2-Classic, VPC in an EC2-VPC-only account] If the Elastic IP address is already associated with a different instance, it is disassociated from that instance and associated with the specified instance. If you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance that has an existing Elastic IP address, the existing address is disassociated from the instance, but remains allocated to your account.

[VPC in an EC2-Classic account] If you don't specify a private IP address, the Elastic IP address is associated with the primary IP address. If the Elastic IP address is already associated with a different instance or a network interface, you get an error unless you allow reassociation. You cannot associate an Elastic IP address with an instance or network interface that has an existing Elastic IP address.

[Subnets in Wavelength Zones] You can associate an IP address from the telecommunication carrier to the instance or network interface.

You cannot associate an Elastic IP address with an interface in a different network border group.

Warning

This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than once, Amazon EC2 doesn't return an error, and you may be charged for each time the Elastic IP address is remapped to the same instance. For more information, see the _Elastic IP Addresses_ section of [Amazon EC2 Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/) .

See also: [AWS API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ec2-2016-11-15/AssociateAddress)

**Request Syntax**

response = client.associate_address(
    AllocationId='string',
    InstanceId='string',
    PublicIp='string',
    AllowReassociation=True|False,
    DryRun=True|False,
    NetworkInterfaceId='string',
    PrivateIpAddress='string'
)

Parameters

*   **AllocationId** (_string_) -- [EC2-VPC] The allocation ID. This is required for EC2-VPC.
*   **InstanceId** (_string_) -- The ID of the instance. This is required for EC2-Classic. For EC2-VPC, you can specify either the instance ID or the network interface ID, but not both. The operation fails if you specify an instance ID unless exactly one network interface is attached.
*   **PublicIp** (_string_) -- The Elastic IP address to associate with the instance. This is required for EC2-Classic.
*   **AllowReassociation** (_boolean_) -- [EC2-VPC] For a VPC in an EC2-Classic account, specify true to allow an Elastic IP address that is already associated with an instance or network interface to be reassociated with the specified instance or network interface. Otherwise, the operation fails. In a VPC in an EC2-VPC-only account, reassociation is automatic, therefore you can specify false to ensure the operation fails if the Elastic IP address is already associated with another resource.
*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **NetworkInterfaceId** (_string_) --

    [EC2-VPC] The ID of the network interface. If the instance has more than one network interface, you must specify a network interface ID.

    For EC2-VPC, you can specify either the instance ID or the network interface ID, but not both.

*   **PrivateIpAddress** (_string_) -- [EC2-VPC] The primary or secondary private IP address to associate with the Elastic IP address. If no private IP address is specified, the Elastic IP address is associated with the primary private IP address.

associate_client_vpn_target_network(kwargs_)

Associates a target network with a Client VPN endpoint. A target network is a subnet in a VPC. You can associate multiple subnets from the same VPC with a Client VPN endpoint. You can associate only one subnet in each Availability Zone. We recommend that you associate at least two subnets to provide Availability Zone redundancy.

If you specified a VPC when you created the Client VPN endpoint or if you have previous subnet associations, the specified subnet must be in the same VPC. To specify a subnet that's in a different VPC, you must first modify the Client VPN endpoint ( ModifyClientVpnEndpoint ) and change the VPC that's associated with it.

associate_dhcp_options(kwargs_)

Associates a set of DHCP options (that you've previously created) with the specified VPC, or associates no DHCP options with the VPC.

After you associate the options with the VPC, any existing instances and all new instances that you launch in that VPC use the options. You don't need to restart or relaunch the instances. They automatically pick up the changes within a few hours, depending on how frequently the instance renews its DHCP lease. You can explicitly renew the lease using the operating system on the instance.

For more information, see [DHCP Options Sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_ .

associate_enclave_certificate_iam_role(kwargs_)

Associates an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with an AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate. This enables the certificate to be used by the ACM for Nitro Enclaves application inside an enclave. For more information, see [AWS Certificate Manager for Nitro Enclaves](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html) in the _AWS Nitro Enclaves User Guide_ .

When the IAM role is associated with the ACM certificate, places the certificate, certificate chain, and encrypted private key in an Amazon S3 bucket that only the associated IAM role can access. The private key of the certificate is encrypted with an AWS-managed KMS customer master (CMK) that has an attached attestation-based CMK policy.

To enable the IAM role to access the Amazon S3 object, you must grant it permission to call s3:GetObject on the Amazon S3 bucket returned by the command. To enable the IAM role to access the AWS KMS CMK, you must grant it permission to call kms:Decrypt on AWS KMS CMK returned by the command. For more information, see [Grant the role permission to access the certificate and encryption key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html#add-policy) in the _AWS Nitro Enclaves User Guide_ .

attach_classic_link_vpc(kwargs_)

Links an EC2-Classic instance to a ClassicLink-enabled VPC through one or more of the VPC's security groups. You cannot link an EC2-Classic instance to more than one VPC at a time. You can only link an instance that's in the running state. An instance is automatically unlinked from a VPC when it's stopped - you can link it to the VPC again when you restart it.

After you've linked an instance, you cannot change the VPC security groups that are associated with it. To change the security groups, you must first unlink the instance, and then link it again.

Linking your instance to a VPC is sometimes referred to as _attaching_ your instance.

authorize_security_group_ingress(kwargs_)

Adds the specified ingress rules to a security group.

An inbound rule permits instances to receive traffic from the specified IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR address ranges, or from the instances associated with the specified destination security groups.

You specify a protocol for each rule (for example, TCP). For TCP and UDP, you must also specify the destination port or port range. For ICMP/ICMPv6, you must also specify the ICMP/ICMPv6 type and code. You can use -1 to mean all types or all codes.

Rule changes are propagated to instances within the security group as quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.

cancel_spot_fleet_requests(kwargs_)

Cancels the specified Spot Fleet requests.

After you cancel a Spot Fleet request, the Spot Fleet launches no new Spot Instances. You must specify whether the Spot Fleet should also terminate its Spot Instances. If you terminate the instances, the Spot Fleet request enters the cancelled_terminating state. Otherwise, the Spot Fleet request enters the cancelled_running state and the instances continue to run until they are interrupted or you terminate them manually.

For more information about the prerequisites and limits when copying an AMI, see [Copying an AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/CopyingAMIs.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

See also: [AWS API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ec2-2016-11-15/CopyImage)

**Request Syntax**

response = client.copy_image(
    ClientToken='string',
    Description='string',
    Encrypted=True|False,
    KmsKeyId='string',
    Name='string',
    SourceImageId='string',
    SourceRegion='string',
    DryRun=True|False
)

Parameters

*   **ClientToken** (_string_) -- Unique, case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure idempotency of the request. For more information, see [How to Ensure Idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .
*   **Description** (_string_) -- A description for the new AMI in the destination Region.
*   **Encrypted** (_boolean_) -- Specifies whether the destination snapshots of the copied image should be encrypted. You can encrypt a copy of an unencrypted snapshot, but you cannot create an unencrypted copy of an encrypted snapshot. The default CMK for EBS is used unless you specify a non-default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) CMK using KmsKeyId . For more information, see [Amazon EBS Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .
*   **KmsKeyId** (_string_) --

    The identifier of the symmetric AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to use when creating encrypted volumes. If this parameter is not specified, your AWS managed CMK for EBS is used. If you specify a CMK, you must also set the encrypted state to true .

    You can specify a CMK using any of the following:

    *   Key ID. For example, 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
    *   Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.
    *   Key ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
    *   Alias ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.

    AWS authenticates the CMK asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an identifier that is not valid, the action can appear to complete, but eventually fails.

    The specified CMK must exist in the destination Region.

    Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric CMKs.

*   **Name** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The name of the new AMI in the destination Region.

*   **SourceImageId** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The ID of the AMI to copy.

*   **SourceRegion** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The name of the Region that contains the AMI to copy.

*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

Return type

    'ImageId': 'ami-438bea42',
    'ResponseMetadata': {
        '...': '...',
    },
}

copy_snapshot(kwargs_)

Copies a point-in-time snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can copy the snapshot within the same Region or from one Region to another. You can use the snapshot to create EBS volumes or Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).

Copies of encrypted EBS snapshots remain encrypted. Copies of unencrypted snapshots remain unencrypted, unless you enable encryption for the snapshot copy operation. By default, encrypted snapshot copies use the default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK); however, you can specify a different CMK.

To copy an encrypted snapshot that has been shared from another account, you must have permissions for the CMK used to encrypt the snapshot.

Snapshots created by copying another snapshot have an arbitrary volume ID that should not be used for any purpose.

For more information, see [Copying an Amazon EBS snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-copy-snapshot.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

See also: [AWS API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ec2-2016-11-15/CopySnapshot)

                },
            ]
        },
    ],
    DryRun=True|False
)

Parameters

*   **Description** (_string_) -- A description for the EBS snapshot.
*   **DestinationRegion** (_string_) --

    The destination Region to use in the PresignedUrl parameter of a snapshot copy operation. This parameter is only valid for specifying the destination Region in a PresignedUrl parameter, where it is required.

    The snapshot copy is sent to the regional endpoint that you sent the HTTP request to (for example, ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com ). With the AWS CLI, this is specified using the --region parameter or the default Region in your AWS configuration file.

    > Please note that this parameter is automatically populated if it is not provided. Including this parameter is not required

*   **Encrypted** (_boolean_) -- To encrypt a copy of an unencrypted snapshot if encryption by default is not enabled, enable encryption using this parameter. Otherwise, omit this parameter. Encrypted snapshots are encrypted, even if you omit this parameter and encryption by default is not enabled. You cannot set this parameter to false. For more information, see [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .
*   **KmsKeyId** (_string_) --

    The identifier of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to use for Amazon EBS encryption. If this parameter is not specified, your AWS managed CMK for EBS is used. If KmsKeyId is specified, the encrypted state must be true .

    You can specify the CMK using any of the following:

    *   Key ID. For example, 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
    *   Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.
    *   Key ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
    *   Alias ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.

    AWS authenticates the CMK asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an ID, alias, or ARN that is not valid, the action can appear to complete, but eventually fails.

*   **PresignedUrl** (_string_) --

    When you copy an encrypted source snapshot using the Amazon EC2 Query API, you must supply a pre-signed URL. This parameter is optional for unencrypted snapshots. For more information, see [Query requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Requests.html) .

    The PresignedUrl should use the snapshot source endpoint, the CopySnapshot action, and include the SourceRegion , SourceSnapshotId , and DestinationRegion parameters. The PresignedUrl must be signed using AWS Signature Version 4. Because EBS snapshots are stored in Amazon S3, the signing algorithm for this parameter uses the same logic that is described in [Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (AWS Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html) in the _Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference_ . An invalid or improperly signed PresignedUrl will cause the copy operation to fail asynchronously, and the snapshot will move to an error state.

    > Please note that this parameter is automatically populated if it is not provided. Including this parameter is not required

*   **SourceRegion** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The ID of the Region that contains the snapshot to be copied.

*   **SourceSnapshotId** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

create_capacity_reservation(kwargs_)

Creates a new Capacity Reservation with the specified attributes.

Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. This gives you the flexibility to selectively add capacity reservations and still get the Regional RI discounts for that usage. By creating Capacity Reservations, you ensure that you always have access to Amazon EC2 capacity when you need it, for as long as you need it. For more information, see [Capacity Reservations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-capacity-reservations.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

Your request to create a Capacity Reservation could fail if Amazon EC2 does not have sufficient capacity to fulfill the request. If your request fails due to Amazon EC2 capacity constraints, either try again at a later time, try in a different Availability Zone, or request a smaller capacity reservation. If your application is flexible across instance types and sizes, try to create a Capacity Reservation with different instance attributes.

Your request could also fail if the requested quantity exceeds your On-Demand Instance limit for the selected instance type. If your request fails due to limit constraints, increase your On-Demand Instance limit for the required instance type and try again. For more information about increasing your instance limits, see [Amazon EC2 Service Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

Parameters

*   **ClientToken** (_string_) -- Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see [How to Ensure Idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html) .
*   **InstanceType** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The instance type for which to reserve capacity. For more information, see [Instance Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

*   **InstancePlatform** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The type of operating system for which to reserve capacity.

*   **AvailabilityZone** (_string_) -- The Availability Zone in which to create the Capacity Reservation.
*   **AvailabilityZoneId** (_string_) -- The ID of the Availability Zone in which to create the Capacity Reservation.
*   **Tenancy** (_string_) --

    Indicates the tenancy of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following tenancy settings:

    *   default - The Capacity Reservation is created on hardware that is shared with other AWS accounts.
    *   dedicated - The Capacity Reservation is created on single-tenant hardware that is dedicated to a single AWS account.
*   **InstanceCount** (_integer_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The number of instances for which to reserve capacity.

*   **EbsOptimized** (_boolean_) -- Indicates whether the Capacity Reservation supports EBS-optimized instances. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal I/O performance. This optimization isn't available with all instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an EBS- optimized instance.
*   **EphemeralStorage** (_boolean_) -- Indicates whether the Capacity Reservation supports instances with temporary, block-level storage.
*   **EndDate** (_datetime_) --

    The date and time at which the Capacity Reservation expires. When a Capacity Reservation expires, the reserved capacity is released and you can no longer launch instances into it. The Capacity Reservation's state changes to expired when it reaches its end date and time.

    You must provide an EndDate value if EndDateType is limited . Omit EndDate if EndDateType is unlimited .

    If the EndDateType is limited , the Capacity Reservation is cancelled within an hour from the specified time. For example, if you specify 5/31/2019, 13:30:55, the Capacity Reservation is guaranteed to end between 13:30:55 and 14:30:55 on 5/31/2019.

*   **EndDateType** (_string_) --

    Indicates the way in which the Capacity Reservation ends. A Capacity Reservation can have one of the following end types:

    *   unlimited - The Capacity Reservation remains active until you explicitly cancel it. Do not provide an EndDate if the EndDateType is unlimited .
    *   limited - The Capacity Reservation expires automatically at a specified date and time. You must provide an EndDate value if the EndDateType value is limited .
*   **InstanceMatchCriteria** (_string_) --

    Indicates the type of instance launches that the Capacity Reservation accepts. The options include:

    *   open - The Capacity Reservation automatically matches all instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone). Instances that have matching attributes run in the Capacity Reservation automatically without specifying any additional parameters.
    *   targeted - The Capacity Reservation only accepts instances that have matching attributes (instance type, platform, and Availability Zone), and explicitly target the Capacity Reservation. This ensures that only permitted instances can use the reserved capacity.

    Default: open

*   **TagSpecifications** (_list_) --

    The tags to apply to the Capacity Reservation during launch.

    *   _(dict) --_

        The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being created.

        *   **ResourceType** _(string) --_

create_customer_gateway(kwargs_)

Provides information to AWS about your VPN customer gateway device. The customer gateway is the appliance at your end of the VPN connection. (The device on the AWS side of the VPN connection is the virtual private gateway.) You must provide the internet-routable IP address of the customer gateway's external interface. The IP address must be static and can be behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).

For devices that use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), you can also provide the device's BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN). You can use an existing ASN assigned to your network. If you don't have an ASN already, you can use a private ASN (in the 64512 - 65534 range).

Note

Amazon EC2 supports all 4-byte ASN numbers in the range of 1 - 2147483647, with the exception of the following:

*   7224 - reserved in the us-east-1 Region
*   9059 - reserved in the eu-west-1 Region
*   17943 - reserved in the ap-southeast-1 Region
*   10124 - reserved in the ap-northeast-1 Region

For more information, see [AWS Site-to-Site VPN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) in the _AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide_ .

Warning

To create more than one customer gateway with the same VPN type, IP address, and BGP ASN, specify a unique device name for each customer gateway. Identical requests return information about the existing customer gateway and do not create new customer gateways.

create_default_vpc(kwargs_)

Creates a default VPC with a size /16 IPv4 CIDR block and a default subnet in each Availability Zone. For more information about the components of a default VPC, see [Default VPC and Default Subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/default-vpc.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_ . You cannot specify the components of the default VPC yourself.

If you deleted your previous default VPC, you can create a default VPC. You cannot have more than one default VPC per Region.

If your account supports EC2-Classic, you cannot use this action to create a default VPC in a Region that supports EC2-Classic. If you want a default VPC in a Region that supports EC2-Classic, see "I really want a default VPC for my existing EC2 account. Is that possible?" in the [Default VPCs FAQ](http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/#Default_VPCs) .

create_dhcp_options(kwargs_)

Creates a set of DHCP options for your VPC. After creating the set, you must associate it with the VPC, causing all existing and new instances that you launch in the VPC to use this set of DHCP options. The following are the individual DHCP options you can specify. For more information about the options, see [RFC 2132](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2132.txt) .

*   domain-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four domain name servers, or AmazonProvidedDNS. The default DHCP option set specifies AmazonProvidedDNS. If specifying more than one domain name server, specify the IP addresses in a single parameter, separated by commas. To have your instance receive a custom DNS hostname as specified in domain-name , you must set domain-name-servers to a custom DNS server.
*   domain-name - If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in us-east-1 , specify ec2.internal . If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in another Region, specify region.compute.internal (for example, ap-northeast-1.compute.internal ). Otherwise, specify a domain name (for example, ExampleCompany.com ). This value is used to complete unqualified DNS hostnames. **Important** : Some Linux operating systems accept multiple domain names separated by spaces. However, Windows and other Linux operating systems treat the value as a single domain, which results in unexpected behavior. If your DHCP options set is associated with a VPC that has instances with multiple operating systems, specify only one domain name.
*   ntp-servers - The IP addresses of up to four Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers.
*   netbios-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four NetBIOS name servers.
*   netbios-node-type - The NetBIOS node type (1, 2, 4, or 8). We recommend that you specify 2 (broadcast and multicast are not currently supported). For more information about these node types, see [RFC 2132](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2132.txt) .

Your VPC automatically starts out with a set of DHCP options that includes only a DNS server that we provide (AmazonProvidedDNS). If you create a set of options, and if your VPC has an internet gateway, make sure to set the domain-name-servers option either to AmazonProvidedDNS or to a domain name server of your choice. For more information, see [DHCP Options Sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_ .

create_egress_only_internet_gateway(kwargs_)

[IPv6 only] Creates an egress-only internet gateway for your VPC. An egress-only internet gateway is used to enable outbound communication over IPv6 from instances in your VPC to the internet, and prevents hosts outside of your VPC from initiating an IPv6 connection with your instance.

Parameters

*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **ClientToken** (_string_) -- Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see [Ensuring Idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html) .
*   **SpotOptions** (_dict_) --

    Describes the configuration of Spot Instances in an EC2 Fleet.

    *   **AllocationStrategy** _(string) --_

        Indicates how to allocate the target Spot Instance capacity across the Spot Instance pools specified by the EC2 Fleet.

        If the allocation strategy is lowest-price , EC2 Fleet launches instances from the Spot Instance pools with the lowest price. This is the default allocation strategy.

        If the allocation strategy is diversified , EC2 Fleet launches instances from all of the Spot Instance pools that you specify.

        If the allocation strategy is capacity-optimized , EC2 Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances that are launching.

    *   **MaintenanceStrategies** _(dict) --_

        The strategies for managing your Spot Instances that are at an elevated risk of being interrupted.

        *   **CapacityRebalance** _(dict) --_

            The strategy to use when Amazon EC2 emits a signal that your Spot Instance is at an elevated risk of being interrupted.

    Describes the configuration of On-Demand Instances in an EC2 Fleet.

    *   **AllocationStrategy** _(string) --_

        The order of the launch template overrides to use in fulfilling On-Demand capacity. If you specify lowest-price , EC2 Fleet uses price to determine the order, launching the lowest price first. If you specify prioritized , EC2 Fleet uses the priority that you assigned to each launch template override, launching the highest priority first. If you do not specify a value, EC2 Fleet defaults to lowest-price .

    *   **CapacityReservationOptions** _(dict) --_

        The strategy for using unused Capacity Reservations for fulfilling On-Demand capacity. Supported only for fleets of type instant .

            If you specify use-capacity-reservations-first , the fleet uses unused Capacity Reservations to fulfill On-Demand capacity up to the target On-Demand capacity. If multiple instance pools have unused Capacity Reservations, the On-Demand allocation strategy (lowest-price or prioritized ) is applied. If the number of unused Capacity Reservations is less than the On-Demand target capacity, the remaining On-Demand target capacity is launched according to the On-Demand allocation strategy (lowest-price or prioritized ).

            If you do not specify a value, the fleet fulfils the On-Demand capacity according to the chosen On-Demand allocation strategy.

    *   **SingleInstanceType** _(boolean) --_

**Response Structure**

*   _(dict) --_

    *   **FleetId** _(string) --_

        The ID of the EC2 Fleet.

    *   **Errors** _(list) --_

        Information about the instances that could not be launched by the fleet. Valid only when **Type** is set to instant .

        *   _(dict) --_

            Describes the instances that could not be launched by the fleet.

            *   **LaunchTemplateAndOverrides** _(dict) --_

                The launch templates and overrides that were used for launching the instances. The values that you specify in the Overrides replace the values in the launch template.

                *   **LaunchTemplateSpecification** _(dict) --_

                    The launch template.

                    *   **LaunchTemplateId** _(string) --_

                        The ID of the launch template. If you specify the template ID, you can't specify the template name.

                    *   **LaunchTemplateName** _(string) --_

                        The name of the launch template. If you specify the template name, you can't specify the template ID.

                    *   **Version** _(string) --_

                        The launch template version number, $Latest , or $Default . You must specify a value, otherwise the request fails.

                        If the value is $Latest , Amazon EC2 uses the latest version of the launch template.

                        If the value is $Default , Amazon EC2 uses the default version of the launch template.

                *   **Overrides** _(dict) --_

                    Any parameters that you specify override the same parameters in the launch template.

                    *   **InstanceType** _(string) --_

                        The instance type.

                    *   **MaxPrice** _(string) --_

                        The maximum price per unit hour that you are willing to pay for a Spot Instance.

                    *   **SubnetId** _(string) --_

                        The ID of the subnet in which to launch the instances.

                    *   **AvailabilityZone** _(string) --_

                        The Availability Zone in which to launch the instances.

                    *   **WeightedCapacity** _(float) --_

                        The number of units provided by the specified instance type.

                    *   **Priority** _(float) --_

                        The priority for the launch template override. If **AllocationStrategy** is set to prioritized , EC2 Fleet uses priority to determine which launch template override to use first in fulfilling On-Demand capacity. The highest priority is launched first. Valid values are whole numbers starting at 0 . The lower the number, the higher the priority. If no number is set, the override has the lowest priority.

                    *   **Placement** _(dict) --_

                        The location where the instance launched, if applicable.

                        *   **GroupName** _(string) --_

                            The name of the placement group that the instance is in.

            *   **Lifecycle** _(string) --_

                Indicates if the instance that could not be launched was a Spot Instance or On-Demand Instance.

            *   **ErrorCode** _(string) --_

create_flow_logs(kwargs_)

Creates one or more flow logs to capture information about IP traffic for a specific network interface, subnet, or VPC.

Flow log data for a monitored network interface is recorded as flow log records, which are log events consisting of fields that describe the traffic flow. For more information, see [Flow Log Records](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html#flow-log-records) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_ .

When publishing to CloudWatch Logs, flow log records are published to a log group, and each network interface has a unique log stream in the log group. When publishing to Amazon S3, flow log records for all of the monitored network interfaces are published to a single log file object that is stored in the specified bucket.

For more information, see [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_ .

        *   **DeviceName** _(string) --_

            The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

        *   **VirtualName** _(string) --_

            The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1 . The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume.

            NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect.

            Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

        *   **Ebs** _(dict) --_

            Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched.

            *   **DeleteOnTermination** _(boolean) --_

                Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more information, see [Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance termination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html#preserving-volumes-on-termination) in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

            *   **Iops** _(integer) --_

                The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 , io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

                The following are the supported values for each volume type:

                *   gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS
                *   io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS
                *   io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for [Instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances) . Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

            *   **SnapshotId** _(string) --_

                The ID of the snapshot.

            *   **VolumeSize** _(integer) --_

                The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a volume size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot size.

                The following are the supported volumes sizes for each volume type:

                *   gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384
                *   io1 and io2 : 4-16,384
                *   st1 : 500-16,384
                *   sc1 : 500-16,384
                *   standard : 1-1,024
            *   **VolumeType** _(string) --_

                The volume type. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volume types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ . If the volume type is io1 or io2 , you must specify the IOPS that the volume supports.

            *   **KmsKeyId** _(string) --_

                Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN) for a customer managed CMK under which the EBS volume is encrypted.

                This parameter is only supported on BlockDeviceMapping objects called by [RunInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html) , [RequestSpotFleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotFleet.html) , and [RequestSpotInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotInstances.html) .

            *   **Throughput** _(integer) --_

                The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000.

            *   **Encrypted** _(boolean) --_

                Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see [Amazon EBS Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-parameters) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

                In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume.

                Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see [Supported instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption_supported_instances) .

    Constraints: 3-128 alphanumeric characters, parentheses (()), square brackets ([]), spaces ( ), periods (.), slashes (/), dashes (-), single quotes ('), at-signs (@), or underscores(_)

*   **NoReboot** (_boolean_) -- By default, Amazon EC2 attempts to shut down and reboot the instance before creating the image. If the No Reboot option is set, Amazon EC2 doesn't shut down the instance before creating the image. When this option is used, file system integrity on the created image can't be guaranteed.
*   **TagSpecifications** (_list_) --

    The tags to apply to the AMI and snapshots on creation. You can tag the AMI, the snapshots, or both.

    *   To tag the AMI, the value for ResourceType must be image .
    *   To tag the snapshots that are created of the root volume and of other EBS volumes that are attached to the instance, the value for ResourceType must be snapshot . The same tag is applied to all of the snapshots that are created.

create_key_pair(kwargs_)

Creates a 2048-bit RSA key pair with the specified name. Amazon EC2 stores the public key and displays the private key for you to save to a file. The private key is returned as an unencrypted PEM encoded PKCS#1 private key. If a key with the specified name already exists, Amazon EC2 returns an error.

You can have up to five thousand key pairs per Region.

The key pair returned to you is available only in the Region in which you create it. If you prefer, you can create your own key pair using a third-party tool and upload it to any Region using ImportKeyPair .

For more information, see [Key Pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

*   **LaunchTemplateId** (_string_) -- The ID of the launch template. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request.
*   **LaunchTemplateName** (_string_) -- The name of the launch template. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request.
*   **SourceVersion** (_string_) -- The version number of the launch template version on which to base the new version. The new version inherits the same launch parameters as the source version, except for parameters that you specify in LaunchTemplateData . Snapshots applied to the block device mapping are ignored when creating a new version unless they are explicitly included.
*   **VersionDescription** (_string_) -- A description for the version of the launch template.
*   **LaunchTemplateData** (_dict_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

            *   **VirtualName** _(string) --_

                The virtual device name (ephemeralN). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1. The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume.

            *   **Ebs** _(dict) --_

                Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched.

                *   **Encrypted** _(boolean) --_

                    Indicates whether the EBS volume is encrypted. Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. If you are creating a volume from a snapshot, you can't specify an encryption value.

                    *   io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                    For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for [Instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances) . Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                    This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                *   **KmsKeyId** _(string) --_

                    The ARN of the symmetric AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) CMK used for encryption.

                *   **VolumeSize** _(integer) --_

                    The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a volume size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot size.

                    The following are the supported volumes sizes for each volume type:

                    *   gp2 and gp3 : 1-16,384
                    *   io1 and io2 : 4-16,384
                    *   st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384
                    *   standard : 1-1,024
                *   **VolumeType** _(string) --_

                    The volume type. The default is gp2 . For more information, see [Amazon EBS volume types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

                *   **Throughput** _(integer) --_

create_nat_gateway(kwargs_)

Creates a NAT gateway in the specified public subnet. This action creates a network interface in the specified subnet with a private IP address from the IP address range of the subnet. Internet-bound traffic from a private subnet can be routed to the NAT gateway, therefore enabling instances in the private subnet to connect to the internet. For more information, see [NAT Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_ .

create_network_acl_entry(kwargs_)

Creates an entry (a rule) in a network ACL with the specified rule number. Each network ACL has a set of numbered ingress rules and a separate set of numbered egress rules. When determining whether a packet should be allowed in or out of a subnet associated with the ACL, we process the entries in the ACL according to the rule numbers, in ascending order. Each network ACL has a set of ingress rules and a separate set of egress rules.

We recommend that you leave room between the rule numbers (for example, 100, 110, 120, ...), and not number them one right after the other (for example, 101, 102, 103, ...). This makes it easier to add a rule between existing ones without having to renumber the rules.

After you add an entry, you can't modify it; you must either replace it, or create an entry and delete the old one.

For more information about network ACLs, see [Network ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_ACLs.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_ .

        Describes an IPv6 address.

        *   **Ipv6Address** _(string) --_

            The IPv6 address.

*   **PrivateIpAddress** (_string_) -- The primary private IPv4 address of the network interface. If you don't specify an IPv4 address, Amazon EC2 selects one for you from the subnet's IPv4 CIDR range. If you specify an IP address, you cannot indicate any IP addresses specified in privateIpAddresses as primary (only one IP address can be designated as primary).
*   **PrivateIpAddresses** (_list_) --

    One or more private IPv4 addresses.

    *   _(dict) --_

        Describes a secondary private IPv4 address for a network interface.

create_placement_group(kwargs_)

Creates a placement group in which to launch instances. The strategy of the placement group determines how the instances are organized within the group.

A cluster placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput. A spread placement group places instances on distinct hardware. A partition placement group places groups of instances in different partitions, where instances in one partition do not share the same hardware with instances in another partition.

For more information, see [Placement groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

create_reserved_instances_listing(kwargs_)

Creates a listing for Amazon EC2 Standard Reserved Instances to be sold in the Reserved Instance Marketplace. You can submit one Standard Reserved Instance listing at a time. To get a list of your Standard Reserved Instances, you can use the DescribeReservedInstances operation.

Note

Only Standard Reserved Instances can be sold in the Reserved Instance Marketplace. Convertible Reserved Instances cannot be sold.

The Reserved Instance Marketplace matches sellers who want to resell Standard Reserved Instance capacity that they no longer need with buyers who want to purchase additional capacity. Reserved Instances bought and sold through the Reserved Instance Marketplace work like any other Reserved Instances.

To sell your Standard Reserved Instances, you must first register as a seller in the Reserved Instance Marketplace. After completing the registration process, you can create a Reserved Instance Marketplace listing of some or all of your Standard Reserved Instances, and specify the upfront price to receive for them. Your Standard Reserved Instance listings then become available for purchase. To view the details of your Standard Reserved Instance listing, you can use the DescribeReservedInstancesListings operation.

For more information, see [Reserved Instance Marketplace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-market-general.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

create_route(kwargs_)

Creates a route in a route table within a VPC.

You must specify one of the following targets: internet gateway or virtual private gateway, NAT instance, NAT gateway, VPC peering connection, network interface, egress-only internet gateway, or transit gateway.

When determining how to route traffic, we use the route with the most specific match. For example, traffic is destined for the IPv4 address 192.0.2.3 , and the route table includes the following two IPv4 routes:

*   192.0.2.0/24 (goes to some target A)
*   192.0.2.0/28 (goes to some target B)

Both routes apply to the traffic destined for 192.0.2.3 . However, the second route in the list covers a smaller number of IP addresses and is therefore more specific, so we use that route to determine where to target the traffic.

For more information about route tables, see [Route Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_ .

**Request Syntax**

response = client.create_route(
    DestinationCidrBlock='string',
    DestinationIpv6CidrBlock='string',
    DestinationPrefixListId='string',
    DryRun=True|False,

    NetworkInterfaceId='string',
    RouteTableId='string',
    VpcPeeringConnectionId='string'
)

Parameters

*   **DestinationCidrBlock** (_string_) -- The IPv4 CIDR address block used for the destination match. Routing decisions are based on the most specific match. We modify the specified CIDR block to its canonical form; for example, if you specify 100.68.0.18/18 , we modify it to 100.68.0.0/18 .
*   **DestinationIpv6CidrBlock** (_string_) -- The IPv6 CIDR block used for the destination match. Routing decisions are based on the most specific match.
*   **DestinationPrefixListId** (_string_) -- The ID of a prefix list used for the destination match.
*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **VpcEndpointId** (_string_) -- The ID of a VPC endpoint. Supported for Gateway Load Balancer endpoints only.
*   **EgressOnlyInternetGatewayId** (_string_) -- [IPv6 traffic only] The ID of an egress-only internet gateway.
*   **GatewayId** (_string_) -- The ID of an internet gateway or virtual private gateway attached to your VPC.
*   **InstanceId** (_string_) -- The ID of a NAT instance in your VPC. The operation fails if you specify an instance ID unless exactly one network interface is attached.
*   **NatGatewayId** (_string_) -- [IPv4 traffic only] The ID of a NAT gateway.
*   **TransitGatewayId** (_string_) -- The ID of a transit gateway.
*   **LocalGatewayId** (_string_) -- The ID of the local gateway.
*   **CarrierGatewayId** (_string_) --

    The ID of the carrier gateway.

    You can only use this option when the VPC contains a subnet which is associated with a Wavelength Zone.

*   **NetworkInterfaceId** (_string_) -- The ID of a network interface.
*   **RouteTableId** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The ID of the route table for the route.

create_security_group(kwargs_)

Creates a security group.

A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Security Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ and [Security Groups for Your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_ .

When you create a security group, you specify a friendly name of your choice. You can have a security group for use in EC2-Classic with the same name as a security group for use in a VPC. However, you can't have two security groups for use in EC2-Classic with the same name or two security groups for use in a VPC with the same name.

You have a default security group for use in EC2-Classic and a default security group for use in your VPC. If you don't specify a security group when you launch an instance, the instance is launched into the appropriate default security group. A default security group includes a default rule that grants instances unrestricted network access to each other.

You can add or remove rules from your security groups using AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress , AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress , RevokeSecurityGroupIngress , and RevokeSecurityGroupEgress .

For more information about VPC security group limits, see [Amazon VPC Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html) .

create_snapshot(kwargs_)

Creates a snapshot of an EBS volume and stores it in Amazon S3. You can use snapshots for backups, to make copies of EBS volumes, and to save data before shutting down an instance.

When a snapshot is created, any AWS Marketplace product codes that are associated with the source volume are propagated to the snapshot.

You can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use. However, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your EBS volume at the time the snapshot command is issued; this might exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the volume long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. However, if you cannot pause all file writes to the volume, you should unmount the volume from within the instance, issue the snapshot command, and then remount the volume to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your volume while the snapshot status is pending .

To create a snapshot for EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.

Snapshots that are taken from encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically encrypted. Your encrypted volumes and any associated snapshots always remain protected.

You can tag your snapshots during creation. For more information, see [Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

For more information, see [Amazon Elastic Block Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html) and [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

**Response Structure**

*   _(dict) --_

    Describes a snapshot.

    *   **DataEncryptionKeyId** _(string) --_

        The data encryption key identifier for the snapshot. This value is a unique identifier that corresponds to the data encryption key that was used to encrypt the original volume or snapshot copy. Because data encryption keys are inherited by volumes created from snapshots, and vice versa, if snapshots share the same data encryption key identifier, then they belong to the same volume/snapshot lineage. This parameter is only returned by DescribeSnapshots .

    *   **Description** _(string) --_

        The description for the snapshot.

    *   **Encrypted** _(boolean) --_

        Indicates whether the snapshot is encrypted.

    *   **KmsKeyId** _(string) --_

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) that was used to protect the volume encryption key for the parent volume.

    *   **OwnerId** _(string) --_

        The AWS account ID of the EBS snapshot owner.

    *   **Progress** _(string) --_

        The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage.

    *   **SnapshotId** _(string) --_

        The ID of the snapshot. Each snapshot receives a unique identifier when it is created.

    *   **StartTime** _(datetime) --_

        The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.

    *   **State** _(string) --_

        The snapshot state.

    *   **StateMessage** _(string) --_

        Encrypted Amazon EBS snapshots are copied asynchronously. If a snapshot copy operation fails (for example, if the proper AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) permissions are not obtained) this field displays error state details to help you diagnose why the error occurred. This parameter is only returned by DescribeSnapshots .

    *   **VolumeId** _(string) --_

        The ID of the volume that was used to create the snapshot. Snapshots created by the CopySnapshot action have an arbitrary volume ID that should not be used for any purpose.

    *   **VolumeSize** _(integer) --_

        The size of the volume, in GiB.

    *   **OwnerAlias** _(string) --_

        The AWS owner alias, from an Amazon-maintained list (amazon ). This is not the user-configured AWS account alias set using the IAM console.

    *   **Tags** _(list) --_

        Any tags assigned to the snapshot.

        *   _(dict) --_

            Describes a tag.

            *   **Key** _(string) --_

                The key of the tag.

                Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with aws: .

            *   **Value** _(string) --_

                The value of the tag.

                Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

Creates a subnet in a specified VPC.

You must specify an IPv4 CIDR block for the subnet. After you create a subnet, you can't change its CIDR block. The allowed block size is between a /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses) and /28 netmask (16 IP addresses). The CIDR block must not overlap with the CIDR block of an existing subnet in the VPC.

If you've associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, you can create a subnet with an IPv6 CIDR block that uses a /64 prefix length.

Warning

AWS reserves both the first four and the last IPv4 address in each subnet's CIDR block. They're not available for use.

If you add more than one subnet to a VPC, they're set up in a star topology with a logical router in the middle.

When you stop an instance in a subnet, it retains its private IPv4 address. It's therefore possible to have a subnet with no running instances (they're all stopped), but no remaining IP addresses available.

For more information about subnets, see [Your VPC and Subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_ .

create_traffic_mirror_filter(kwargs_)

Creates a Traffic Mirror filter.

A Traffic Mirror filter is a set of rules that defines the traffic to mirror.

By default, no traffic is mirrored. To mirror traffic, use [CreateTrafficMirrorFilterRule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTrafficMirrorFilterRule.htm) to add Traffic Mirror rules to the filter. The rules you add define what traffic gets mirrored. You can also use [ModifyTrafficMirrorFilterNetworkServices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyTrafficMirrorFilterNetworkServices.html) to mirror supported network services.

create_traffic_mirror_session(kwargs_)

Creates a Traffic Mirror session.

A Traffic Mirror session actively copies packets from a Traffic Mirror source to a Traffic Mirror target. Create a filter, and then assign it to the session to define a subset of the traffic to mirror, for example all TCP traffic.

The Traffic Mirror source and the Traffic Mirror target (monitoring appliances) can be in the same VPC, or in a different VPC connected via VPC peering or a transit gateway.

By default, no traffic is mirrored. Use [CreateTrafficMirrorFilter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTrafficMirrorFilter.htm) to create filter rules that specify the traffic to mirror.

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The ID of the Traffic Mirror filter.

*   **PacketLength** (_integer_) --

    The number of bytes in each packet to mirror. These are bytes after the VXLAN header. Do not specify this parameter when you want to mirror the entire packet. To mirror a subset of the packet, set this to the length (in bytes) that you want to mirror. For example, if you set this value to 100, then the first 100 bytes that meet the filter criteria are copied to the target.

    If you do not want to mirror the entire packet, use the PacketLength parameter to specify the number of bytes in each packet to mirror.

*   **SessionNumber** (_integer_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The session number determines the order in which sessions are evaluated when an interface is used by multiple sessions. The first session with a matching filter is the one that mirrors the packets.

create_traffic_mirror_target(kwargs_)

Creates a target for your Traffic Mirror session.

A Traffic Mirror target is the destination for mirrored traffic. The Traffic Mirror source and the Traffic Mirror target (monitoring appliances) can be in the same VPC, or in different VPCs connected via VPC peering or a transit gateway.

A Traffic Mirror target can be a network interface, or a Network Load Balancer.

To use the target in a Traffic Mirror session, use [CreateTrafficMirrorSession](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTrafficMirrorSession.htm) .

create_transit_gateway(kwargs_)

Creates a transit gateway.

You can use a transit gateway to interconnect your virtual private clouds (VPC) and on-premises networks. After the transit gateway enters the available state, you can attach your VPCs and VPN connections to the transit gateway.

To attach your VPCs, use CreateTransitGatewayVpcAttachment .

To attach a VPN connection, use CreateCustomerGateway to create a customer gateway and specify the ID of the customer gateway and the ID of the transit gateway in a call to CreateVpnConnection .

When you create a transit gateway, we create a default transit gateway route table and use it as the default association route table and the default propagation route table. You can use CreateTransitGatewayRouteTable to create additional transit gateway route tables. If you disable automatic route propagation, we do not create a default transit gateway route table. You can use EnableTransitGatewayRouteTablePropagation to propagate routes from a resource attachment to a transit gateway route table. If you disable automatic associations, you can use AssociateTransitGatewayRouteTable to associate a resource attachment with a transit gateway route table.

create_volume(kwargs_)

Creates an EBS volume that can be attached to an instance in the same Availability Zone.

You can create a new empty volume or restore a volume from an EBS snapshot. Any AWS Marketplace product codes from the snapshot are propagated to the volume.

You can create encrypted volumes. Encrypted volumes must be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically encrypted. For more information, see [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

You can tag your volumes during creation. For more information, see [Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

For more information, see [Creating an Amazon EBS volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-volume.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

)

Parameters

*   **AvailabilityZone** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The Availability Zone in which to create the volume.

*   **Encrypted** (_boolean_) --

    Indicates whether the volume should be encrypted. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see [Encryption by default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-by-default) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

    Encrypted Amazon EBS volumes must be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see [Supported instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption_supported_instances) .

*   **Iops** (_integer_) --

    The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 , io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

    The following are the supported values for each volume type:

    *   gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS
    *   io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS
    *   io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

    For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for [Instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances) . Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

    This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

*   **KmsKeyId** (_string_) --

    The identifier of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to use for Amazon EBS encryption. If this parameter is not specified, your AWS managed CMK for EBS is used. If KmsKeyId is specified, the encrypted state must be true .

    You can specify the CMK using any of the following:

    *   Key ID. For example, 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
    *   Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.
    *   Key ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
    *   Alias ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.

    AWS authenticates the CMK asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an ID, alias, or ARN that is not valid, the action can appear to complete, but eventually fails.

*   **OutpostArn** (_string_) -- The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost.
*   **Size** (_integer_) --

    The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a volume size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot size.

    The following are the supported volumes sizes for each volume type:

    *   gp2 and gp3 : 1-16,384
    *   io1 and io2 : 4-16,384
    *   st1 and sc1 : 125-16,384
    *   standard : 1-1,024
*   **SnapshotId** (_string_) -- The snapshot from which to create the volume. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size.
*   **VolumeType** (_string_) --

    The volume type. This parameter can be one of the following values:

    *   General Purpose SSD: gp2 | gp3
    *   Provisioned IOPS SSD: io1 | io2
    *   Throughput Optimized HDD: st1
    *   Cold HDD: sc1
    *   Magnetic: standard

    For more information, see [Amazon EBS volume types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

    Default: gp2

*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **TagSpecifications** (_list_) --

    The tags to apply to the volume during creation.

    *   _(dict) --_

        The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being created.

        *   **ResourceType** _(string) --_

            The type of resource to tag. Currently, the resource types that support tagging on creation are: capacity-reservation | carrier-gateway | client-vpn-endpoint | customer-gateway | dedicated-host | dhcp-options | egress-only-internet-gateway | elastic-ip | elastic-gpu | export-image-task | export-instance-task | fleet | fpga-image | host-reservation | image | import-image-task | import-snapshot-task | instance | internet-gateway | ipv4pool-ec2 | ipv6pool-ec2 | key-pair | launch-template | local-gateway-route-table-vpc-association | placement-group | prefix-list | natgateway | network-acl | network-interface | reserved-instances [|](#id250)route-table | security-group | snapshot | spot-fleet-request | spot-instances-request | snapshot | subnet | traffic-mirror-filter | traffic-mirror-session | traffic-mirror-target | transit-gateway | transit-gateway-attachment | transit-gateway-multicast-domain | transit-gateway-route-table | volume [|](#id252)vpc | vpc-peering-connection | vpc-endpoint (for interface and gateway endpoints) | vpc-endpoint-service (for AWS PrivateLink) | vpc-flow-log | vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

create_vpc(kwargs_)

Creates a VPC with the specified IPv4 CIDR block. The smallest VPC you can create uses a /28 netmask (16 IPv4 addresses), and the largest uses a /16 netmask (65,536 IPv4 addresses). For more information about how large to make your VPC, see [Your VPC and Subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_ .

You can optionally request an IPv6 CIDR block for the VPC. You can request an Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block from Amazon's pool of IPv6 addresses, or an IPv6 CIDR block from an IPv6 address pool that you provisioned through bring your own IP addresses ([BYOIP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html) ).

By default, each instance you launch in the VPC has the default DHCP options, which include only a default DNS server that we provide (AmazonProvidedDNS). For more information, see [DHCP Options Sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_ .

You can specify the instance tenancy value for the VPC when you create it. You can't change this value for the VPC after you create it. For more information, see [Dedicated Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-instance.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

)

Parameters

*   **CidrBlock** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The IPv4 network range for the VPC, in CIDR notation. For example, 10.0.0.0/16 . We modify the specified CIDR block to its canonical form; for example, if you specify 100.68.0.18/18 , we modify it to 100.68.0.0/18 .

*   **AmazonProvidedIpv6CidrBlock** (_boolean_) -- Requests an Amazon-provided IPv6 CIDR block with a /56 prefix length for the VPC. You cannot specify the range of IP addresses, or the size of the CIDR block.
*   **Ipv6Pool** (_string_) -- The ID of an IPv6 address pool from which to allocate the IPv6 CIDR block.
*   **Ipv6CidrBlock** (_string_) --

    The IPv6 CIDR block from the IPv6 address pool. You must also specify Ipv6Pool in the request.

    To let Amazon choose the IPv6 CIDR block for you, omit this parameter.

*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **InstanceTenancy** (_string_) --

    The tenancy options for instances launched into the VPC. For default , instances are launched with shared tenancy by default. You can launch instances with any tenancy into a shared tenancy VPC. For dedicated , instances are launched as dedicated tenancy instances by default. You can only launch instances with a tenancy of dedicated or host into a dedicated tenancy VPC.

    > **Important:** The host value cannot be used with this parameter. Use the default or dedicated values only.

    Default: default

*   **Ipv6CidrBlockNetworkBorderGroup** (_string_) --

create_vpc_endpoint(kwargs_)

Creates a VPC endpoint for a specified service. An endpoint enables you to create a private connection between your VPC and the service. The service may be provided by AWS, an AWS Marketplace Partner, or another AWS account. For more information, see [VPC Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_ .

A gateway endpoint serves as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined for the AWS service. You can specify an endpoint policy to attach to the endpoint, which will control access to the service from your VPC. You can also specify the VPC route tables that use the endpoint.

An interface endpoint is a network interface in your subnet that serves as an endpoint for communicating with the specified service. You can specify the subnets in which to create an endpoint, and the security groups to associate with the endpoint network interface.

A GatewayLoadBalancer endpoint is a network interface in your subnet that serves an endpoint for communicating with a Gateway Load Balancer that you've configured as a VPC endpoint service.

Use DescribeVpcEndpointServices to get a list of supported services.

Parameters

*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **VpcEndpointType** (_string_) --

    The type of endpoint.

    Default: Gateway

*   **VpcId** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The ID of the VPC in which the endpoint will be used.

*   **ServiceName** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The service name. To get a list of available services, use the DescribeVpcEndpointServices request, or get the name from the service provider.

*   **PolicyDocument** (_string_) -- (Interface and gateway endpoints) A policy to attach to the endpoint that controls access to the service. The policy must be in valid JSON format. If this parameter is not specified, we attach a default policy that allows full access to the service.
*   **RouteTableIds** (_list_) --

    (Gateway endpoint) One or more route table IDs.

    *   _(string) --_
*   **SubnetIds** (_list_) --

    (Interface and Gateway Load Balancer endpoints) The ID of one or more subnets in which to create an endpoint network interface. For a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint, you can specify one subnet only.

    *   _(string) --_
*   **SecurityGroupIds** (_list_) --

    (Interface endpoint) The ID of one or more security groups to associate with the endpoint network interface.

    *   _(string) --_
*   **ClientToken** (_string_) -- Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see [How to Ensure Idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html) .
*   **PrivateDnsEnabled** (_boolean_) --

    (Interface endpoint) Indicates whether to associate a private hosted zone with the specified VPC. The private hosted zone contains a record set for the default public DNS name for the service for the Region (for example, kinesis.us-east-1.amazonaws.com ), which resolves to the private IP addresses of the endpoint network interfaces in the VPC. This enables you to make requests to the default public DNS name for the service instead of the public DNS names that are automatically generated by the VPC endpoint service.

    To use a private hosted zone, you must set the following VPC attributes to true : enableDnsHostnames and enableDnsSupport . Use ModifyVpcAttribute to set the VPC attributes.

    Default: true

*   **TagSpecifications** (_list_) --

    The tags to associate with the endpoint.

    *   _(dict) --_

        The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being created.

create_vpc_peering_connection(kwargs_)

Requests a VPC peering connection between two VPCs: a requester VPC that you own and an accepter VPC with which to create the connection. The accepter VPC can belong to another AWS account and can be in a different Region to the requester VPC. The requester VPC and accepter VPC cannot have overlapping CIDR blocks.

Note

Limitations and rules apply to a VPC peering connection. For more information, see the [limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/vpc-peering-basics.html#vpc-peering-limitations) section in the _VPC Peering Guide_ .

The owner of the accepter VPC must accept the peering request to activate the peering connection. The VPC peering connection request expires after 7 days, after which it cannot be accepted or rejected.

If you create a VPC peering connection request between VPCs with overlapping CIDR blocks, the VPC peering connection has a status of failed .

create_vpn_connection(kwargs_)

Creates a VPN connection between an existing virtual private gateway or transit gateway and a customer gateway. The supported connection type is ipsec.1 .

The response includes information that you need to give to your network administrator to configure your customer gateway.

Warning

We strongly recommend that you use HTTPS when calling this operation because the response contains sensitive cryptographic information for configuring your customer gateway device.

If you decide to shut down your VPN connection for any reason and later create a new VPN connection, you must reconfigure your customer gateway with the new information returned from this call.

This is an idempotent operation. If you perform the operation more than once, Amazon EC2 doesn't return an error.

For more information, see [AWS Site-to-Site VPN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) in the _AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide_ .

delete_vpn_connection(kwargs_)

Deletes the specified VPN connection.

If you're deleting the VPC and its associated components, we recommend that you detach the virtual private gateway from the VPC and delete the VPC before deleting the VPN connection. If you believe that the tunnel credentials for your VPN connection have been compromised, you can delete the VPN connection and create a new one that has new keys, without needing to delete the VPC or virtual private gateway. If you create a new VPN connection, you must reconfigure the customer gateway device using the new configuration information returned with the new VPN connection ID.

For certificate-based authentication, delete all AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) private certificates used for the AWS-side tunnel endpoints for the VPN connection before deleting the VPN connection.

                        If you specify use-capacity-reservations-first , the fleet uses unused Capacity Reservations to fulfill On-Demand capacity up to the target On-Demand capacity. If multiple instance pools have unused Capacity Reservations, the On-Demand allocation strategy (lowest-price or prioritized ) is applied. If the number of unused Capacity Reservations is less than the On-Demand target capacity, the remaining On-Demand target capacity is launched according to the On-Demand allocation strategy (lowest-price or prioritized ).

                        If you do not specify a value, the fleet fulfils the On-Demand capacity according to the chosen On-Demand allocation strategy.

describe_id_format(kwargs_)

Describes the ID format settings for your resources on a per-Region basis, for example, to view which resource types are enabled for longer IDs. This request only returns information about resource types whose ID formats can be modified; it does not return information about other resource types.

The following resource types support longer IDs: bundle | conversion-task | customer-gateway | dhcp-options | elastic-ip-allocation | elastic-ip-association | export-task | flow-log | image | import-task | instance | internet-gateway | network-acl | network-acl-association | network-interface | network-interface-attachment | prefix-list | reservation | route-table | route-table-association | security-group | snapshot | subnet | subnet-cidr-block-association | volume | vpc | vpc-cidr-block-association | vpc-endpoint | vpc-peering-connection | vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

These settings apply to the IAM user who makes the request; they do not apply to the entire AWS account. By default, an IAM user defaults to the same settings as the root user, unless they explicitly override the settings by running the ModifyIdFormat command. Resources created with longer IDs are visible to all IAM users, regardless of these settings and provided that they have permission to use the relevant Describe command for the resource type.

**Response Structure**

*   _(dict) --_

    Describes an image attribute.

    *   **BlockDeviceMappings** _(list) --_

        The block device mapping entries.

        *   _(dict) --_

            Describes a block device mapping.

            *   **DeviceName** _(string) --_

                The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

            *   **VirtualName** _(string) --_

                The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1 . The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume.

                NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect.

                Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

            *   **Ebs** _(dict) --_

                Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched.

                *   **DeleteOnTermination** _(boolean) --_

                    Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more information, see [Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance termination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html#preserving-volumes-on-termination) in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

                *   **Iops** _(integer) --_

                    The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 , io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

                    The following are the supported values for each volume type:

                    *   gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS
                    *   io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS
                    *   io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                    For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for [Instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances) . Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                    This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                *   **SnapshotId** _(string) --_

                    The ID of the snapshot.

                *   **VolumeSize** _(integer) --_

                    The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a volume size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot size.

                    The following are the supported volumes sizes for each volume type:

                    *   gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384
                    *   io1 and io2 : 4-16,384
                    *   st1 : 500-16,384
                    *   sc1 : 500-16,384
                    *   standard : 1-1,024
                *   **VolumeType** _(string) --_

                    The volume type. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volume types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ . If the volume type is io1 or io2 , you must specify the IOPS that the volume supports.

                *   **KmsKeyId** _(string) --_

                    Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN) for a customer managed CMK under which the EBS volume is encrypted.

                    This parameter is only supported on BlockDeviceMapping objects called by [RunInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html) , [RequestSpotFleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotFleet.html) , and [RequestSpotInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotInstances.html) .

                *   **Throughput** _(integer) --_

                    The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                    This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                    Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000.

                *   **Encrypted** _(boolean) --_

                    Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see [Amazon EBS Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-parameters) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

                    In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume.

                    Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see [Supported instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption_supported_instances) .

                    This parameter is not returned by .

            *   **NoDevice** _(string) --_

describe_images(kwargs_)

Describes the specified images (AMIs, AKIs, and ARIs) available to you or all of the images available to you.

The images available to you include public images, private images that you own, and private images owned by other AWS accounts for which you have explicit launch permissions.

Recently deregistered images appear in the returned results for a short interval and then return empty results. After all instances that reference a deregistered AMI are terminated, specifying the ID of the image results in an error indicating that the AMI ID cannot be found.

                    *   **DeviceName** _(string) --_

                        The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

                    *   **VirtualName** _(string) --_

                        The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1 . The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume.

                        NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect.

                        Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

                            Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more information, see [Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance termination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html#preserving-volumes-on-termination) in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

                        *   **Iops** _(integer) --_

                            The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 , io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

                            The following are the supported values for each volume type:

                            *   gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS
                            *   io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS
                            *   io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                            For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for [Instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances) . Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                            This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                        *   **SnapshotId** _(string) --_

                            The ID of the snapshot.

                        *   **VolumeSize** _(integer) --_

                            The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a volume size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot size.

                            The following are the supported volumes sizes for each volume type:

                            *   gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384
                            *   io1 and io2 : 4-16,384
                            *   st1 : 500-16,384
                            *   sc1 : 500-16,384
                            *   standard : 1-1,024
                        *   **VolumeType** _(string) --_

                            The volume type. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volume types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ . If the volume type is io1 or io2 , you must specify the IOPS that the volume supports.

                        *   **KmsKeyId** _(string) --_

                            Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN) for a customer managed CMK under which the EBS volume is encrypted.

                            This parameter is only supported on BlockDeviceMapping objects called by [RunInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html) , [RequestSpotFleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotFleet.html) , and [RequestSpotInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotInstances.html) .

                        *   **Throughput** _(integer) --_

                            The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                            Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000.

                        *   **Encrypted** _(boolean) --_

                            Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see [Amazon EBS Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-parameters) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

                            In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume.

                            Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see [Supported instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption_supported_instances) .

                            This parameter is not returned by .

describe_instance_credit_specifications(kwargs_)

Describes the credit option for CPU usage of the specified burstable performance instances. The credit options are standard and unlimited .

If you do not specify an instance ID, Amazon EC2 returns burstable performance instances with the unlimited credit option, as well as instances that were previously configured as T2, T3, and T3a with the unlimited credit option. For example, if you resize a T2 instance, while it is configured as unlimited , to an M4 instance, Amazon EC2 returns the M4 instance.

If you specify one or more instance IDs, Amazon EC2 returns the credit option (standard or unlimited ) of those instances. If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, such as an instance that is not a burstable performance instance, an error is returned.

Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This interval is usually less than one hour.

If an Availability Zone is experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you specify only instance IDs in an unaffected zone, the call works normally.

For more information, see [Burstable performance instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

Parameters

*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **LocationType** (_string_) -- The location type.
*   **Filters** (_list_) --

    One or more filters. Filter names and values are case-sensitive.

    *   location - This depends on the location type. For example, if the location type is region (default), the location is the Region code (for example, us-east-2 .)
    *   instance-type - The instance type. For example, c5.2xlarge .

    *   _(dict) --_

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs. The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with the describe operation. For example:

        *   DescribeAvailabilityZones
        *   DescribeImages
        *   DescribeInstances
        *   DescribeKeyPairs
        *   DescribeSecurityGroups
        *   DescribeSnapshots
        *   DescribeSubnets
        *   DescribeTags
        *   DescribeVolumes
        *   DescribeVpcs

        *   **Name** _(string) --_

            The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        *   **Values** _(list) --_

            The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

            *   _(string) --_
*   **MaxResults** (_integer_) -- The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The remaining results can be seen by sending another request with the next token value.
*   **NextToken** (_string_) -- The token to retrieve the next page of results.

describe_instances(kwargs_)

Describes the specified instances or all instances.

If you specify instance IDs, the output includes information for only the specified instances. If you specify filters, the output includes information for only those instances that meet the filter criteria. If you do not specify instance IDs or filters, the output includes information for all instances, which can affect performance. We recommend that you use pagination to ensure that the operation returns quickly and successfully.

If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, an error is returned. If you specify an instance that you do not own, it is not included in the output.

Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This interval is usually less than one hour.

If you describe instances in the rare case where an Availability Zone is experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs that are in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you describe instances and specify only instance IDs that are in an unaffected zone, the call works normally.

                        > pending - The metadata options are being updated and the instance is not ready to process metadata traffic with the new selection.
                        >
                        > applied - The metadata options have been successfully applied on the instance.

                    *   **HttpTokens** _(string) --_

                        The state of token usage for your instance metadata requests. If the parameter is not specified in the request, the default state is optional .

                        If the state is optional , you can choose to retrieve instance metadata with or without a signed token header on your request. If you retrieve the IAM role credentials without a token, the version 1.0 role credentials are returned. If you retrieve the IAM role credentials using a valid signed token, the version 2.0 role credentials are returned.

                        If the state is required , you must send a signed token header with any instance metadata retrieval requests. In this state, retrieving the IAM role credentials always returns the version 2.0 credentials; the version 1.0 credentials are not available.

                    *   **HttpPutResponseHopLimit** _(integer) --_

                        The desired HTTP PUT response hop limit for instance metadata requests. The larger the number, the further instance metadata requests can travel.

                        Default: 1

                        Possible values: Integers from 1 to 64

                    *   **HttpEndpoint** _(string) --_

                        This parameter enables or disables the HTTP metadata endpoint on your instances. If the parameter is not specified, the default state is enabled .

                        Note

                        If you specify a value of disabled , you will not be able to access your instance metadata.

                *   **EnclaveOptions** _(dict) --_

                    Indicates whether the instance is enabled for AWS Nitro Enclaves.

                    *   **Enabled** _(boolean) --_

                        If this parameter is set to true , the instance is enabled for AWS Nitro Enclaves; otherwise, it is not enabled for AWS Nitro Enclaves.

    *   **NextToken** _(string) --_

        The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is null when there are no more results to return.

describe_principal_id_format(kwargs_)

Describes the ID format settings for the root user and all IAM roles and IAM users that have explicitly specified a longer ID (17-character ID) preference.

By default, all IAM roles and IAM users default to the same ID settings as the root user, unless they explicitly override the settings. This request is useful for identifying those IAM users and IAM roles that have overridden the default ID settings.

The following resource types support longer IDs: bundle | conversion-task | customer-gateway | dhcp-options | elastic-ip-allocation | elastic-ip-association | export-task | flow-log | image | import-task | instance | internet-gateway | network-acl | network-acl-association | network-interface | network-interface-attachment | prefix-list | reservation | route-table | route-table-association | security-group | snapshot | subnet | subnet-cidr-block-association | volume | vpc | vpc-cidr-block-association | vpc-endpoint | vpc-peering-connection | vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

describe_reserved_instances_listings(kwargs_)

Describes your account's Reserved Instance listings in the Reserved Instance Marketplace.

The Reserved Instance Marketplace matches sellers who want to resell Reserved Instance capacity that they no longer need with buyers who want to purchase additional capacity. Reserved Instances bought and sold through the Reserved Instance Marketplace work like any other Reserved Instances.

As a seller, you choose to list some or all of your Reserved Instances, and you specify the upfront price to receive for them. Your Reserved Instances are then listed in the Reserved Instance Marketplace and are available for purchase.

As a buyer, you specify the configuration of the Reserved Instance to purchase, and the Marketplace matches what you're searching for with what's available. The Marketplace first sells the lowest priced Reserved Instances to you, and continues to sell available Reserved Instance listings to you until your demand is met. You are charged based on the total price of all of the listings that you purchase.

For more information, see [Reserved Instance Marketplace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-market-general.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

describe_reserved_instances_offerings(kwargs_)

Describes Reserved Instance offerings that are available for purchase. With Reserved Instances, you purchase the right to launch instances for a period of time. During that time period, you do not receive insufficient capacity errors, and you pay a lower usage rate than the rate charged for On-Demand instances for the actual time used.

If you have listed your own Reserved Instances for sale in the Reserved Instance Marketplace, they will be excluded from these results. This is to ensure that you do not purchase your own Reserved Instances.

For more information, see [Reserved Instance Marketplace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-market-general.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

    *   instance-type - The instance type that is covered by the reservation.
    *   marketplace - Set to true to show only Reserved Instance Marketplace offerings. When this filter is not used, which is the default behavior, all offerings from both AWS and the Reserved Instance Marketplace are listed.
    *   product-description - The Reserved Instance product platform description. Instances that include (Amazon VPC) in the product platform description will only be displayed to EC2-Classic account holders and are for use with Amazon VPC. (Linux/UNIX | Linux/UNIX (Amazon VPC) | SUSE Linux | SUSE Linux (Amazon VPC) | Red Hat Enterprise Linux | Red Hat Enterprise Linux (Amazon VPC) | Windows | Windows (Amazon VPC) | Windows with SQL Server Standard | Windows with SQL Server Standard (Amazon VPC) | Windows with SQL Server Web | Windows with SQL Server Web (Amazon VPC) | Windows with SQL Server Enterprise | Windows with SQL Server Enterprise (Amazon VPC) )
    *   reserved-instances-offering-id - The Reserved Instances offering ID.
    *   scope - The scope of the Reserved Instance (Availability Zone or Region ).
    *   usage-price - The usage price of the Reserved Instance, per hour (for example, 0.84).

    *   _(dict) --_

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs. The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with the describe operation. For example:

        *   DescribeAvailabilityZones
        *   DescribeImages
        *   DescribeInstances
        *   DescribeKeyPairs
        *   DescribeSecurityGroups
        *   DescribeSnapshots
        *   DescribeSubnets
        *   DescribeTags
        *   DescribeVolumes
        *   DescribeVpcs

            The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        *   **Values** _(list) --_

            The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

            *   _(string) --_
*   **IncludeMarketplace** (_boolean_) -- Include Reserved Instance Marketplace offerings in the response.
*   **InstanceType** (_string_) -- The instance type that the reservation will cover (for example, m1.small ). For more information, see [Instance Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .
*   **MaxDuration** (_integer_) --

    The maximum duration (in seconds) to filter when searching for offerings.

    Default: 94608000 (3 years)

*   **MaxInstanceCount** (_integer_) --

    The maximum number of instances to filter when searching for offerings.

    Default: 20

*   **MinDuration** (_integer_) --

    The minimum duration (in seconds) to filter when searching for offerings.

    Default: 2592000 (1 month)

*   **OfferingClass** (_string_) -- The offering class of the Reserved Instance. Can be standard or convertible .
*   **ProductDescription** (_string_) -- The Reserved Instance product platform description. Instances that include (Amazon VPC) in the description are for use with Amazon VPC.
*   **ReservedInstancesOfferingIds** (_list_) --

    One or more Reserved Instances offering IDs.

    *   _(string) --_
*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **InstanceTenancy** (_string_) --

    The tenancy of the instances covered by the reservation. A Reserved Instance with a tenancy of dedicated is applied to instances that run in a VPC on single-tenant hardware (i.e., Dedicated Instances).

    > **Important:** The host value cannot be used with this parameter. Use the default or dedicated values only.

    Default: default

*   **MaxResults** (_integer_) --

    The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another request with the returned NextToken value. The maximum is 100.

    Default: 100

*   **NextToken** (_string_) -- The token to retrieve the next page of results.
*   **OfferingType** (_string_) -- The Reserved Instance offering type. If you are using tools that predate the 2011-11-01 API version, you only have access to the Medium Utilization Reserved Instance offering type.

describe_route_tables(kwargs_)

Describes one or more of your route tables.

Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table. If a subnet is not explicitly associated with any route table, it is implicitly associated with the main route table. This command does not return the subnet ID for implicit associations.

For more information, see [Route Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html) in the _Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide_ .

describe_snapshots(kwargs_)

Describes the specified EBS snapshots available to you or all of the EBS snapshots available to you.

The snapshots available to you include public snapshots, private snapshots that you own, and private snapshots owned by other AWS accounts for which you have explicit create volume permissions.

The create volume permissions fall into the following categories:

*   _public_ : The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions for the snapshot to the all group. All AWS accounts have create volume permissions for these snapshots.
*   _explicit_ : The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions to a specific AWS account.
*   _implicit_ : An AWS account has implicit create volume permissions for all snapshots it owns.

The list of snapshots returned can be filtered by specifying snapshot IDs, snapshot owners, or AWS accounts with create volume permissions. If no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns all snapshots for which you have create volume permissions.

If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that have the specified IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID, an error is returned. If you specify a snapshot ID for which you do not have access, it is not included in the returned results.

If you specify one or more snapshot owners using the OwnerIds option, only snapshots from the specified owners and for which you have access are returned. The results can include the AWS account IDs of the specified owners, amazon for snapshots owned by Amazon, or self for snapshots that you own.

If you specify a list of restorable users, only snapshots with create snapshot permissions for those users are returned. You can specify AWS account IDs (if you own the snapshots), self for snapshots for which you own or have explicit permissions, or all for public snapshots.

If you are describing a long list of snapshots, we recommend that you paginate the output to make the list more manageable. The MaxResults parameter sets the maximum number of results returned in a single page. If the list of results exceeds your MaxResults value, then that number of results is returned along with a NextToken value that can be passed to a subsequent DescribeSnapshots request to retrieve the remaining results.

To get the state of fast snapshot restores for a snapshot, use DescribeFastSnapshotRestores .

Parameters

*   **Filters** (_list_) --

    The filters.

    *   description - A description of the snapshot.
    *   encrypted - Indicates whether the snapshot is encrypted (true | false )
    *   owner-alias - The owner alias, from an Amazon-maintained list (amazon ). This is not the user-configured AWS account alias set using the IAM console. We recommend that you use the related parameter instead of this filter.
    *   owner-id - The AWS account ID of the owner. We recommend that you use the related parameter instead of this filter.
    *   progress - The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage (for example, 80%).
    *   snapshot-id - The snapshot ID.
    *   start-time - The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.
    *   status - The status of the snapshot (pending | completed | error ).
    *   tag :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.
    *   tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
    *   volume-id - The ID of the volume the snapshot is for.
    *   volume-size - The size of the volume, in GiB.

    *   _(dict) --_

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs. The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with the describe operation. For example:

        *   DescribeAvailabilityZones
        *   DescribeImages
        *   DescribeInstances
        *   DescribeKeyPairs
        *   DescribeSecurityGroups

            *   _(string) --_
*   **MaxResults** (_integer_) -- The maximum number of snapshot results returned by DescribeSnapshots in paginated output. When this parameter is used, DescribeSnapshots only returns MaxResults results in a single page along with a NextToken response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another DescribeSnapshots request with the returned NextToken value. This value can be between 5 and 1,000; if MaxResults is given a value larger than 1,000, only 1,000 results are returned. If this parameter is not used, then DescribeSnapshots returns all results. You cannot specify this parameter and the snapshot IDs parameter in the same request.
*   **NextToken** (_string_) -- The NextToken value returned from a previous paginated DescribeSnapshots request where MaxResults was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the NextToken value. This value is null when there are no more results to return.
*   **OwnerIds** (_list_) --

    Scopes the results to snapshots with the specified owners. You can specify a combination of AWS account IDs, self , and amazon .

    *   _(string) --_
*   **RestorableByUserIds** (_list_) --

    The IDs of the AWS accounts that can create volumes from the snapshot.

    *   _(string) --_

This parameter is only returned by DescribeSnapshots .

            *   **VolumeId** _(string) --_

                The ID of the volume that was used to create the snapshot. Snapshots created by the CopySnapshot action have an arbitrary volume ID that should not be used for any purpose.

    *   **SpotFleetRequestConfigs** _(list) --_

        Information about the configuration of your Spot Fleet.

        *   _(dict) --_

            Describes a Spot Fleet request.

            *   **ActivityStatus** _(string) --_

                The progress of the Spot Fleet request. If there is an error, the status is error . After all requests are placed, the status is pending_fulfillment . If the size of the fleet is equal to or greater than its target capacity, the status is fulfilled . If the size of the fleet is decreased, the status is pending_termination while Spot Instances are terminating.

            *   **CreateTime** _(datetime) --_

                The creation date and time of the request.

            *   **SpotFleetRequestConfig** _(dict) --_

                The configuration of the Spot Fleet request.

                *   **AllocationStrategy** _(string) --_

                    Indicates how to allocate the target Spot Instance capacity across the Spot Instance pools specified by the Spot Fleet request.

                    If the allocation strategy is lowestPrice , Spot Fleet launches instances from the Spot Instance pools with the lowest price. This is the default allocation strategy.

                    If the allocation strategy is diversified , Spot Fleet launches instances from all the Spot Instance pools that you specify.

                    If the allocation strategy is capacityOptimized , Spot Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances that are launching.

                *   **OnDemandAllocationStrategy** _(string) --_

                    The order of the launch template overrides to use in fulfilling On-Demand capacity. If you specify lowestPrice , Spot Fleet uses price to determine the order, launching the lowest price first. If you specify prioritized , Spot Fleet uses the priority that you assign to each Spot Fleet launch template override, launching the highest priority first. If you do not specify a value, Spot Fleet defaults to lowestPrice .

                *   **SpotMaintenanceStrategies** _(dict) --_

                    The strategies for managing your Spot Instances that are at an elevated risk of being interrupted.

                    *   **CapacityRebalance** _(dict) --_

                        The strategy to use when Amazon EC2 emits a signal that your Spot Instance is at an elevated risk of being interrupted.

                        *   **ReplacementStrategy** _(string) --_

                            The replacement strategy to use. Only available for fleets of type maintain . You must specify a value, otherwise you get an error.

                            To allow Spot Fleet to launch a replacement Spot Instance when an instance rebalance notification is emitted for a Spot Instance in the fleet, specify launch .

                            Note

                            When a replacement instance is launched, the instance marked for rebalance is not automatically terminated. You can terminate it, or you can leave it running. You are charged for all instances while they are running.

                *   **ClientToken** _(string) --_

                    A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of your listings. This helps to avoid duplicate listings. For more information, see [Ensuring Idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html) .

                *   **ExcessCapacityTerminationPolicy** _(string) --_

                    Indicates whether running Spot Instances should be terminated if you decrease the target capacity of the Spot Fleet request below the current size of the Spot Fleet.

                *   **FulfilledCapacity** _(float) --_

                    The number of units fulfilled by this request compared to the set target capacity. You cannot set this value.

                *   **OnDemandFulfilledCapacity** _(float) --_

                    The number of On-Demand units fulfilled by this request compared to the set target On-Demand capacity.

                *   **IamFleetRole** _(string) --_

                    The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that grants the Spot Fleet the permission to request, launch, terminate, and tag instances on your behalf. For more information, see [Spot Fleet prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-requests.html#spot-fleet-prerequisites) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances_ . Spot Fleet can terminate Spot Instances on your behalf when you cancel its Spot Fleet request using [CancelSpotFleetRequests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CancelSpotFleetRequests) or when the Spot Fleet request expires, if you set TerminateInstancesWithExpiration .

                *   **LaunchSpecifications** _(list) --_

                    The launch specifications for the Spot Fleet request. If you specify LaunchSpecifications , you can't specify LaunchTemplateConfigs . If you include On-Demand capacity in your request, you must use LaunchTemplateConfigs .

                    *   _(dict) --_

                        Describes the launch specification for one or more Spot Instances. If you include On-Demand capacity in your fleet request or want to specify an EFA network device, you can't use SpotFleetLaunchSpecification ; you must use [LaunchTemplateConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_LaunchTemplateConfig.html) .

                        *   **SecurityGroups** _(list) --_

                            One or more security groups. When requesting instances in a VPC, you must specify the IDs of the security groups. When requesting instances in EC2-Classic, you can specify the names or the IDs of the security groups.

                            *   _(dict) --_

                                Describes a security group.

                                *   **GroupName** _(string) --_

                                    The name of the security group.

                                *   **GroupId** _(string) --_

                        *   **BlockDeviceMappings** _(list) --_

                            One or more block devices that are mapped to the Spot Instances. You can't specify both a snapshot ID and an encryption value. This is because only blank volumes can be encrypted on creation. If a snapshot is the basis for a volume, it is not blank and its encryption status is used for the volume encryption status.

                            *   _(dict) --_

                                Describes a block device mapping.

                                *   **DeviceName** _(string) --_

                                    The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

                                *   **VirtualName** _(string) --_

                                    The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1 . The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume.

                                    NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect.

                                    Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

                                *   **Ebs** _(dict) --_

                                    Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched.

                                    *   **DeleteOnTermination** _(boolean) --_

                                        Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination.

                                    *   **Iops** _(integer) --_

                                        The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 , io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

                                        The following are the supported values for each volume type:

                                        *   gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS
                                        *   io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS
                                        *   io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                                        For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for [Instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances) . Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                                        This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                                        *   gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384
                                        *   io1 and io2 : 4-16,384
                                        *   st1 : 500-16,384
                                        *   sc1 : 500-16,384
                                        *   standard : 1-1,024

                                        Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see [Amazon EBS Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-parameters) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

                                        In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume.

                                        Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see [Supported instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption_supported_instances) .

describe_spot_instance_requests(kwargs_)

Describes the specified Spot Instance requests.

You can use DescribeSpotInstanceRequests to find a running Spot Instance by examining the response. If the status of the Spot Instance is fulfilled , the instance ID appears in the response and contains the identifier of the instance. Alternatively, you can use [DescribeInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeInstances) with a filter to look for instances where the instance lifecycle is spot .

We recommend that you set MaxResults to a value between 5 and 1000 to limit the number of results returned. This paginates the output, which makes the list more manageable and returns the results faster. If the list of results exceeds your MaxResults value, then that number of results is returned along with a NextToken value that can be passed to a subsequent DescribeSpotInstanceRequests request to retrieve the remaining results.

Spot Instance requests are deleted four hours after they are canceled and their instances are terminated.

    *   status-message - The message explaining the status of the Spot Instance request.
    *   tag :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.
    *   tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
    *   type - The type of Spot Instance request (one-time | persistent ).
    *   valid-from - The start date of the request.
    *   valid-until - The end date of the request.

    *   _(dict) --_

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs. The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with the describe operation. For example:

        *   DescribeAvailabilityZones
        *   DescribeImages
        *   DescribeInstances
        *   DescribeKeyPairs
        *   DescribeSecurityGroups
        *   DescribeSnapshots
        *   DescribeSubnets
        *   DescribeTags
        *   DescribeVolumes
        *   DescribeVpcs

        *   **Name** _(string) --_

            The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        *   **Values** _(list) --_

            The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

            *   _(string) --_
*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **SpotInstanceRequestIds** (_list_) --

    One or more Spot Instance request IDs.

    *   _(string) --_
*   **NextToken** (_string_) -- The token to request the next set of results. This value is null when there are no more results to return.
*   **MaxResults** (_integer_) -- The maximum number of results to return in a single call. Specify a value between 5 and 1000. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned NextToken value.

                            NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect.

                            Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

                        *   **Ebs** _(dict) --_

                            Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched.

                            *   **DeleteOnTermination** _(boolean) --_

                                Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more information, see [Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance termination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html#preserving-volumes-on-termination) in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

                                The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 , io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

                                The following are the supported values for each volume type:

                                *   gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS
                                *   io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS
                                *   io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                                For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for [Instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances) . Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                                Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see [Amazon EBS Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-parameters) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

                                In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume.

                                Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see [Supported instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption_supported_instances) .

describe_spot_price_history(kwargs_)

Describes the Spot price history. For more information, see [Spot Instance pricing history](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances-history.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances_ .

When you specify a start and end time, this operation returns the prices of the instance types within the time range that you specified and the time when the price changed. The price is valid within the time period that you specified; the response merely indicates the last time that the price changed.

Parameters

*   **Filters** (_list_) --

    One or more filters.

    *   availability-zone - The Availability Zone for which prices should be returned.
    *   instance-type - The type of instance (for example, m3.medium ).
    *   product-description - The product description for the Spot price (Linux/UNIX | Red Hat Enterprise Linux | SUSE Linux | Windows | Linux/UNIX (Amazon VPC) | Red Hat Enterprise Linux (Amazon VPC) | SUSE Linux (Amazon VPC) | Windows (Amazon VPC) ).
    *   spot-price - The Spot price. The value must match exactly (or use wildcards; greater than or less than comparison is not supported).
    *   timestamp - The time stamp of the Spot price history, in UTC format (for example, _YYYY_ -_MM_ -_DD_ T*HH* :_MM_ :_SS_ Z). You can use wildcards (* and ?). Greater than or less than comparison is not supported.

    *   _(dict) --_

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs. The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with the describe operation. For example:

        *   DescribeAvailabilityZones
        *   DescribeImages
        *   DescribeInstances
        *   DescribeKeyPairs
        *   DescribeSecurityGroups
        *   DescribeSnapshots
        *   DescribeSubnets
        *   DescribeTags
        *   DescribeVolumes
        *   DescribeVpcs

        *   **Name** _(string) --_

            The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        *   **Values** _(list) --_

            The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

            *   _(string) --_
*   **AvailabilityZone** (_string_) -- Filters the results by the specified Availability Zone.
*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **EndTime** (_datetime_) -- The date and time, up to the current date, from which to stop retrieving the price history data, in UTC format (for example, _YYYY_ -_MM_ -_DD_ T*HH* :_MM_ :_SS_ Z).
*   **InstanceTypes** (_list_) --

    Filters the results by the specified instance types.

    *   _(string) --_
*   **MaxResults** (_integer_) -- The maximum number of results to return in a single call. Specify a value between 1 and 1000. The default value is 1000. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned NextToken value.
*   **NextToken** (_string_) -- The token for the next set of results.
*   **ProductDescriptions** (_list_) --

    Filters the results by the specified basic product descriptions.

    *   _(string) --_
*   **StartTime** (_datetime_) -- The date and time, up to the past 90 days, from which to start retrieving the price history data, in UTC format (for example, _YYYY_ -_MM_ -_DD_ T*HH* :_MM_ :_SS_ Z).

describe_volume_status(kwargs_)

Describes the status of the specified volumes. Volume status provides the result of the checks performed on your volumes to determine events that can impair the performance of your volumes. The performance of a volume can be affected if an issue occurs on the volume's underlying host. If the volume's underlying host experiences a power outage or system issue, after the system is restored, there could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this occurs. Volume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in response to the event.

The DescribeVolumeStatus operation provides the following information about the specified volumes:

> _Status_ : Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible values are ok , impaired , warning , or insufficient-data . If all checks pass, the overall status of the volume is ok . If the check fails, the overall status is impaired . If the status is insufficient-data , then the checks might still be taking place on your volume at the time. We recommend that you retry the request. For more information about volume status, see [Monitoring the status of your volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-status.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .
>
> _Events_ : Reflect the cause of a volume status and might require you to take action. For example, if your volume returns an impaired status, then the volume event might be potential-data-inconsistency . This means that your volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and might have inconsistent data.
>
> _Actions_ : Reflect the actions you might have to take in response to an event. For example, if the status of the volume is impaired and the volume event shows potential-data-inconsistency , then the action shows enable-volume-io . This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling the EnableVolumeIO action and then check the volume for data consistency.

Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the volume state. Therefore, volume status does not indicate volumes in the error state (for example, when a volume is incapable of accepting I/O.)

    *   _(dict) --_

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs. The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with the describe operation. For example:

        *   DescribeAvailabilityZones
        *   DescribeImages
        *   DescribeInstances
        *   DescribeKeyPairs
        *   DescribeSecurityGroups

        *   DescribeVpcs

        *   **Name** _(string) --_

            The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        *   **Values** _(list) --_

            The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

            *   _(string) --_
*   **MaxResults** (_integer_) -- The maximum number of volume results returned by DescribeVolumeStatus in paginated output. When this parameter is used, the request only returns MaxResults results in a single page along with a NextToken response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another request with the returned NextToken value. This value can be between 5 and 1,000; if MaxResults is given a value larger than 1,000, only 1,000 results are returned. If this parameter is not used, then DescribeVolumeStatus returns all results. You cannot specify this parameter and the volume IDs parameter in the same request.
*   **NextToken** (_string_) -- The NextToken value to include in a future DescribeVolumeStatus request. When the results of the request exceed MaxResults , this value can be used to retrieve the next page of results. This value is null when there are no more results to return.
*   **VolumeIds** (_list_) --

    The IDs of the volumes.

    Default: Describes all your volumes.

    *   _(string) --_
*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

describe_volumes(kwargs_)

Describes the specified EBS volumes or all of your EBS volumes.

If you are describing a long list of volumes, we recommend that you paginate the output to make the list more manageable. The MaxResults parameter sets the maximum number of results returned in a single page. If the list of results exceeds your MaxResults value, then that number of results is returned along with a NextToken value that can be passed to a subsequent DescribeVolumes request to retrieve the remaining results.

For more information about EBS volumes, see [Amazon EBS volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumes.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

    *   status - The state of the volume (creating | available | in-use | deleting | deleted | error ).
    *   tag :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.
    *   tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
    *   volume-id - The volume ID.
    *   volume-type - The Amazon EBS volume type (gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | st1 | sc1 | standard )

    *   _(dict) --_

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs. The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with the describe operation. For example:

        *   DescribeAvailabilityZones
        *   DescribeImages
        *   DescribeInstances
        *   DescribeKeyPairs
        *   DescribeSecurityGroups
        *   DescribeSnapshots
        *   DescribeSubnets
        *   DescribeTags
        *   DescribeVolumes
        *   DescribeVpcs

        *   **Name** _(string) --_

            The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

        *   **Values** _(list) --_

            The filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

            *   _(string) --_
*   **VolumeIds** (_list_) --

    The volume IDs.

    *   _(string) --_
*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **MaxResults** (_integer_) -- The maximum number of volume results returned by DescribeVolumes in paginated output. When this parameter is used, DescribeVolumes only returns MaxResults results in a single page along with a NextToken response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another DescribeVolumes request with the returned NextToken value. This value can be between 5 and 500; if MaxResults is given a value larger than 500, only 500 results are returned. If this parameter is not used, then DescribeVolumes returns all results. You cannot specify this parameter and the volume IDs parameter in the same request.
*   **NextToken** (_string_) -- The NextToken value returned from a previous paginated DescribeVolumes request where MaxResults was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the NextToken value. This value is null when there are no more results to return.

describe_volumes_modifications(kwargs_)

Describes the most recent volume modification request for the specified EBS volumes.

If a volume has never been modified, some information in the output will be null. If a volume has been modified more than once, the output includes only the most recent modification request.

You can also use CloudWatch Events to check the status of a modification to an EBS volume. For information about CloudWatch Events, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/) . For more information, see [Monitoring volume modifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html#monitoring_mods) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

            ]
        },
    ],
    MaxResults=123,
    NextToken='string'
)

Parameters

*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **ServiceIds** (_list_) --

    The IDs of one or more services.

    *   _(string) --_
*   **Filters** (_list_) --

    One or more filters.

    *   service-name - The name of the service.

    *   tag :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.
    *   tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.

    *   _(dict) --_

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs. The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with the describe operation. For example:

        *   DescribeAvailabilityZones
        *   DescribeImages

        },
    ],
    MaxResults=123,
    NextToken='string'
)

Parameters

*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **VpcEndpointIds** (_list_) --

    One or more endpoint IDs.

    *   _(string) --_
*   **Filters** (_list_) --

    One or more filters.

    *   service-name - The name of the service.

For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA , specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.
    *   tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.

    *   _(dict) --_

        A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more specific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be used to match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as tags, attributes, or IDs. The filters supported by a describe operation are documented with the describe operation.

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The ID of the VPC.


Returns

None

**Examples**

This example detaches the specified Internet gateway from the specified VPC.

response = client.detach_internet_gateway(
    InternetGatewayId='igw-c0a643a9',
    VpcId='vpc-a01106c2',

    'ResponseMetadata': {
        '...': '...',
    },
}

detach_network_interface(kwargs_)

Detaches a network interface from an instance.

See also: [AWS API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ec2-2016-11-15/DetachNetworkInterface)

**Request Syntax**

response = client.detach_network_interface(
    AttachmentId='string',
    DryRun=True|False,
    Force=True|False
)

Parameters

*   **AttachmentId** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The ID of the attachment.

*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **Force** (_boolean_) --

    Specifies whether to force a detachment.

    Note

    *   Use the Force parameter only as a last resort to detach a network interface from a failed instance.
    *   If you use the Force parameter to detach a network interface, you might not be able to attach a different network interface to the same index on the instance without first stopping and starting the instance.
    *   If you force the detachment of a network interface, the [instance metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html) might not get updated. This means that the attributes associated with the detached network interface might still be visible. The instance metadata will get updated when you stop and start the instance.


Returns

None

**Examples**

This example detaches the specified network interface from its attached instance.

response = client.detach_network_interface(
    AttachmentId='eni-attach-66c4350a',
)

print(response)

Expected Output:

{
    'ResponseMetadata': {
        '...': '...',
    },
}

detach_volume(kwargs_)

Detaches an EBS volume from an instance. Make sure to unmount any file systems on the device within your operating system before detaching the volume. Failure to do so can result in the volume becoming stuck in the busy state while detaching. If this happens, detachment can be delayed indefinitely until you unmount the volume, force detachment, reboot the instance, or all three. If an EBS volume is the root device of an instance, it can't be detached while the instance is running. To detach the root volume, stop the instance first.

When a volume with an AWS Marketplace product code is detached from an instance, the product code is no longer associated with the instance.

For more information, see [Detaching an Amazon EBS volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-detaching-volume.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

See also: [AWS API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ec2-2016-11-15/DetachVolume)

**Request Syntax**

response = client.detach_volume(
    Device='string',
    Force=True|False,
    InstanceId='string',
    VolumeId='string',
    DryRun=True|False
)

Parameters

*   **Device** (_string_) -- The device name.
*   **Force** (_boolean_) -- Forces detachment if the previous detachment attempt did not occur cleanly (for example, logging into an instance, unmounting the volume, and detaching normally). This option can lead to data loss or a corrupted file system. Use this option only as a last resort to detach a volume from a failed instance. The instance won't have an opportunity to flush file system caches or file system metadata. If you use this option, you must perform file system check and repair procedures.
*   **InstanceId** (_string_) -- The ID of the instance. If you are detaching a Multi-Attach enabled volume, you must specify an instance ID.
*   **VolumeId** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The ID of the volume.

*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

disassociate_enclave_certificate_iam_role(kwargs_)

Disassociates an IAM role from an AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate. Disassociating an IAM role from an ACM certificate removes the Amazon S3 object that contains the certificate, certificate chain, and encrypted private key from the Amazon S3 bucket. It also revokes the IAM role's permission to use the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) customer master key (CMK) used to encrypt the private key. This effectively revokes the role's permission to use the certificate.

get_launch_template_data(kwargs_)

Retrieves the configuration data of the specified instance. You can use this data to create a launch template.

This action calls on other describe actions to get instance information. Depending on your instance configuration, you may need to allow the following actions in your IAM policy: DescribeSpotInstanceRequests, DescribeInstanceCreditSpecifications, DescribeVolumes, DescribeInstanceAttribute, and DescribeElasticGpus. Or, you can allow describe* depending on your instance requirements.

get_paginator(_operation_name_)

Create a paginator for an operation.

Parameters

**operation_name** (_string_) -- The operation name. This is the same name as the method name on the client. For example, if the method name is create_foo, and you'd normally invoke the operation as client.create_foo(**kwargs), if the create_foo operation can be paginated, you can use the call client.get_paginator("create_foo").

Raises OperationNotPageableError

Raised if the operation is not pageable. You can use the client.can_paginate method to check if an operation is pageable.

Return type

L{botocore.paginate.Paginator}

Returns

A paginator object.

get_password_data(kwargs_)

Retrieves the encrypted administrator password for a running Windows instance.

The Windows password is generated at boot by the EC2Config service or EC2Launch scripts (Windows Server 2016 and later). This usually only happens the first time an instance is launched. For more information, see [EC2Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/UsingConfig_WinAMI.html) and [EC2Launch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2launch.html) in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

For the EC2Config service, the password is not generated for rebundled AMIs unless Ec2SetPassword is enabled before bundling.

The password is encrypted using the key pair that you specified when you launched the instance. You must provide the corresponding key pair file.

When you launch an instance, password generation and encryption may take a few minutes. If you try to retrieve the password before it's available, the output returns an empty string. We recommend that you wait up to 15 minutes after launching an instance before trying to retrieve the generated password.

            The format of the disk image being imported.

            Valid values: OVA | VHD | VHDX [|](#id526)VMDK

        *   **SnapshotId** _(string) --_

            The ID of the EBS snapshot to be used for importing the snapshot.

        *   **Url** _(string) --_

            The URL to the Amazon S3-based disk image being imported. The URL can either be a https URL ([https://](https://)..) or an Amazon S3 URL (s3://..)

        *   **UserBucket** _(dict) --_

            The S3 bucket for the disk image.

            *   **S3Bucket** _(string) --_

                The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where the disk image is located.

            *   **S3Key** _(string) --_

                The file name of the disk image.

*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **Encrypted** (_boolean_) -- Specifies whether the destination AMI of the imported image should be encrypted. The default CMK for EBS is used unless you specify a non-default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) CMK using KmsKeyId . For more information, see [Amazon EBS Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .
*   **Hypervisor** (_string_) --

    The target hypervisor platform.

    Valid values: xen

*   **KmsKeyId** (_string_) --

    An identifier for the symmetric AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to use when creating the encrypted AMI. This parameter is only required if you want to use a non-default CMK; if this parameter is not specified, the default CMK for EBS is used. If a KmsKeyId is specified, the Encrypted flag must also be set.

    The CMK identifier may be provided in any of the following formats:

    *   Key ID
    *   Key alias. The alias ARN contains the arn:aws:kms namespace, followed by the Region of the CMK, the AWS account ID of the CMK owner, the alias namespace, and then the CMK alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:_us-east-1_ :_012345678910_ :alias/_ExampleAlias_ .
    *   ARN using key ID. The ID ARN contains the arn:aws:kms namespace, followed by the Region of the CMK, the AWS account ID of the CMK owner, the key namespace, and then the CMK ID. For example, arn:aws:kms:_us-east-1_ :_012345678910_ :key/_abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef_ .
    *   ARN using key alias. The alias ARN contains the arn:aws:kms namespace, followed by the Region of the CMK, the AWS account ID of the CMK owner, the alias namespace, and then the CMK alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:_us-east-1_ :_012345678910_ :alias/_ExampleAlias_ .

    AWS parses KmsKeyId asynchronously, meaning that the action you call may appear to complete even though you provided an invalid identifier. This action will eventually report failure.

    The specified CMK must exist in the Region that the AMI is being copied to.

    Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric CMKs.

*   **LicenseType** (_string_) --

    The license type to be used for the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) after importing.

    By default, we detect the source-system operating system (OS) and apply the appropriate license. Specify AWS to replace the source-system license with an AWS license, if appropriate. Specify BYOL to retain the source-system license, if appropriate.

    To use BYOL , you must have existing licenses with rights to use these licenses in a third party cloud, such as AWS. For more information, see [Prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-image-import.html#prerequisites-image) in the VM Import/Export User Guide.

*   **Platform** (_string_) --

    The operating system of the virtual machine.

    Valid values: Windows | Linux

*   **RoleName** (_string_) -- The name of the role to use when not using the default role, 'vmimport'.
*   **LicenseSpecifications** (_list_) --

    The ARNs of the license configurations.

    *   _(dict) --_

        The request information of license configurations.

        *   **LicenseConfigurationArn** _(string) --_

            The ARN of a license configuration.

*   **TagSpecifications** (_list_) --

    The tags to apply to the image being imported.

    *   _(dict) --_

        The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being created.

        *   **ResourceType** _(string) --_

            The type of resource to tag. Currently, the resource types that support tagging on creation are: capacity-reservation | carrier-gateway | client-vpn-endpoint | customer-gateway | dedicated-host | dhcp-options | egress-only-internet-gateway | elastic-ip | elastic-gpu | export-image-task | export-instance-task | fleet | fpga-image | host-reservation | image | import-image-task | import-snapshot-task | instance | internet-gateway | ipv4pool-ec2 | ipv6pool-ec2 | key-pair | launch-template | local-gateway-route-table-vpc-association | placement-group | prefix-list | natgateway | network-acl | network-interface | reserved-instances [|](#id528)route-table | security-group | snapshot | spot-fleet-request | spot-instances-request | snapshot | subnet | traffic-mirror-filter | traffic-mirror-session | traffic-mirror-target | transit-gateway | transit-gateway-attachment | transit-gateway-multicast-domain | transit-gateway-route-table | volume [|](#id530)vpc | vpc-peering-connection | vpc-endpoint (for interface and gateway endpoints) | vpc-endpoint-service (for AWS PrivateLink) | vpc-flow-log | vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

            To tag a resource after it has been created, see [CreateTags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTags.html) .

        *   **Tags** _(list) --_

            The tags to apply to the resource.

            *   _(dict) --_

                Describes a tag.

                *   **Key** _(string) --_

                    The key of the tag.

                    Constraints: Tag keys are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 127 Unicode characters. May not begin with aws: .

                *   **Value** _(string) --_

                    The value of the tag.

                    Constraints: Tag values are case-sensitive and accept a maximum of 255 Unicode characters.

import_key_pair(kwargs_)

Imports the public key from an RSA key pair that you created with a third-party tool. Compare this with CreateKeyPair , in which AWS creates the key pair and gives the keys to you (AWS keeps a copy of the public key). With ImportKeyPair, you create the key pair and give AWS just the public key. The private key is never transferred between you and AWS.

For more information about key pairs, see [Key Pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

        The size of the uploaded disk image, in GiB.

    *   **UploadStart** _(datetime) --_

        The time that the disk upload starts.

*   **ClientToken** (_string_) -- Token to enable idempotency for VM import requests.
*   **Description** (_string_) -- The description string for the import snapshot task.
*   **DiskContainer** (_dict_) --

    Information about the disk container.

    *   **Description** _(string) --_

        The description of the disk image being imported.

    *   **Format** _(string) --_

        The format of the disk image being imported.

        Valid values: VHD | VMDK

    *   **Url** _(string) --_

        The URL to the Amazon S3-based disk image being imported. It can either be a https URL ([https://](https://)..) or an Amazon S3 URL (s3://..).

    *   **UserBucket** _(dict) --_

        The Amazon S3 bucket for the disk image.

        *   **S3Bucket** _(string) --_

            The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where the disk image is located.

        *   **S3Key** _(string) --_

            The file name of the disk image.

*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **Encrypted** (_boolean_) -- Specifies whether the destination snapshot of the imported image should be encrypted. The default CMK for EBS is used unless you specify a non-default AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) CMK using KmsKeyId . For more information, see [Amazon EBS Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .
*   **KmsKeyId** (_string_) --

    An identifier for the symmetric AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to use when creating the encrypted snapshot. This parameter is only required if you want to use a non-default CMK; if this parameter is not specified, the default CMK for EBS is used. If a KmsKeyId is specified, the Encrypted flag must also be set.

    The CMK identifier may be provided in any of the following formats:

    *   Key ID
    *   Key alias. The alias ARN contains the arn:aws:kms namespace, followed by the Region of the CMK, the AWS account ID of the CMK owner, the alias namespace, and then the CMK alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:_us-east-1_ :_012345678910_ :alias/_ExampleAlias_ .
    *   ARN using key ID. The ID ARN contains the arn:aws:kms namespace, followed by the Region of the CMK, the AWS account ID of the CMK owner, the key namespace, and then the CMK ID. For example, arn:aws:kms:_us-east-1_ :_012345678910_ :key/_abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef_ .
    *   ARN using key alias. The alias ARN contains the arn:aws:kms namespace, followed by the Region of the CMK, the AWS account ID of the CMK owner, the alias namespace, and then the CMK alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:_us-east-1_ :_012345678910_ :alias/_ExampleAlias_ .

    AWS parses KmsKeyId asynchronously, meaning that the action you call may appear to complete even though you provided an invalid identifier. This action will eventually report failure.

    The specified CMK must exist in the Region that the snapshot is being copied to.

    Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric CMKs.

*   **RoleName** (_string_) -- The name of the role to use when not using the default role, 'vmimport'.
*   **TagSpecifications** (_list_) --

    The tags to apply to the snapshot being imported.

    *   _(dict) --_

        The tags to apply to a resource when the resource is being created.

        *   **ResourceType** _(string) --_

            The type of resource to tag. Currently, the resource types that support tagging on creation are: capacity-reservation | carrier-gateway | client-vpn-endpoint | customer-gateway | dedicated-host | dhcp-options | egress-only-internet-gateway | elastic-ip | elastic-gpu | export-image-task | export-instance-task | fleet | fpga-image | host-reservation | image | import-image-task | import-snapshot-task | instance | internet-gateway | ipv4pool-ec2 | ipv6pool-ec2 | key-pair | launch-template | local-gateway-route-table-vpc-association | placement-group | prefix-list | natgateway | network-acl | network-interface | reserved-instances [|](#id539)route-table | security-group | snapshot | spot-fleet-request | spot-instances-request | snapshot | subnet | traffic-mirror-filter | traffic-mirror-session | traffic-mirror-target | transit-gateway | transit-gateway-attachment | transit-gateway-multicast-domain | transit-gateway-route-table | volume [|](#id541)vpc | vpc-peering-connection | vpc-endpoint (for interface and gateway endpoints) | vpc-endpoint-service (for AWS PrivateLink) | vpc-flow-log | vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

            To tag a resource after it has been created, see [CreateTags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTags.html) .

        *   **Tags** _(list) --_

            The tags to apply to the resource.

            *   _(dict) --_

modify_default_credit_specification(kwargs_)

Modifies the default credit option for CPU usage of burstable performance instances. The default credit option is set at the account level per AWS Region, and is specified per instance family. All new burstable performance instances in the account launch using the default credit option.

> ModifyDefaultCreditSpecification is an asynchronous operation, which works at an AWS Region level and modifies the credit option for each Availability Zone. All zones in a Region are updated within five minutes. But if instances are launched during this operation, they might not get the new credit option until the zone is updated. To verify whether the update has occurred, you can call GetDefaultCreditSpecification and check DefaultCreditSpecification for updates.

For more information, see [Burstable performance instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

modify_ebs_default_kms_key_id(kwargs_)

Changes the default customer master key (CMK) for EBS encryption by default for your account in this Region.

AWS creates a unique AWS managed CMK in each Region for use with encryption by default. If you change the default CMK to a symmetric customer managed CMK, it is used instead of the AWS managed CMK. To reset the default CMK to the AWS managed CMK for EBS, use ResetEbsDefaultKmsKeyId . Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric CMKs.

If you delete or disable the customer managed CMK that you specified for use with encryption by default, your instances will fail to launch.

For more information, see [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

See also: [AWS API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ec2-2016-11-15/ModifyEbsDefaultKmsKeyId)

**Request Syntax**

response = client.modify_ebs_default_kms_key_id(
    KmsKeyId='string',
    DryRun=True|False
)

Parameters

*   **KmsKeyId** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The identifier of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) to use for Amazon EBS encryption. If this parameter is not specified, your AWS managed CMK for EBS is used. If KmsKeyId is specified, the encrypted state must be true .

    You can specify the CMK using any of the following:

    *   Key ID. For example, 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
    *   Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.
    *   Key ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.
    *   Alias ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.

    AWS authenticates the CMK asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an ID, alias, or ARN that is not valid, the action can appear to complete, but eventually fails.

    Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric CMKs.

*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

Return type

dict

Returns

**Response Syntax**

{
    'KmsKeyId': 'string'
}

**Response Structure**

*   _(dict) --_

    *   **KmsKeyId** _(string) --_

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the default CMK for encryption by default.


modify_fleet(kwargs_)

Modifies the specified EC2 Fleet.

You can only modify an EC2 Fleet request of type maintain .

While the EC2 Fleet is being modified, it is in the modifying state.

To scale up your EC2 Fleet, increase its target capacity. The EC2 Fleet launches the additional Spot Instances according to the allocation strategy for the EC2 Fleet request. If the allocation strategy is lowest-price , the EC2 Fleet launches instances using the Spot Instance pool with the lowest price. If the allocation strategy is diversified , the EC2 Fleet distributes the instances across the Spot Instance pools. If the allocation strategy is capacity-optimized , EC2 Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances that are launching.

To scale down your EC2 Fleet, decrease its target capacity. First, the EC2 Fleet cancels any open requests that exceed the new target capacity. You can request that the EC2 Fleet terminate Spot Instances until the size of the fleet no longer exceeds the new target capacity. If the allocation strategy is lowest-price , the EC2 Fleet terminates the instances with the highest price per unit. If the allocation strategy is capacity-optimized , the EC2 Fleet terminates the instances in the Spot Instance pools that have the least available Spot Instance capacity. If the allocation strategy is diversified , the EC2 Fleet terminates instances across the Spot Instance pools. Alternatively, you can request that the EC2 Fleet keep the fleet at its current size, but not replace any Spot Instances that are interrupted or that you terminate manually.

If you are finished with your EC2 Fleet for now, but will use it again later, you can set the target capacity to 0.

Parameters

*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **ExcessCapacityTerminationPolicy** (_string_) -- Indicates whether running instances should be terminated if the total target capacity of the EC2 Fleet is decreased below the current size of the EC2 Fleet.
*   **LaunchTemplateConfigs** (_list_) --

    The launch template and overrides.

    *   _(dict) --_

        Describes a launch template and overrides.

        *   **LaunchTemplateSpecification** _(dict) --_

            The launch template to use. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request.

            *   **LaunchTemplateId** _(string) --_

                The ID of the launch template. If you specify the template ID, you can't specify the template name.

            *   **LaunchTemplateName** _(string) --_

                The name of the launch template. If you specify the template name, you can't specify the template ID.

            *   **Version** _(string) --_

                The launch template version number, $Latest , or $Default . You must specify a value, otherwise the request fails.

                If the value is $Latest , Amazon EC2 uses the latest version of the launch template.

                If the value is $Default , Amazon EC2 uses the default version of the launch template.

        *   **Overrides** _(list) --_

            Any parameters that you specify override the same parameters in the launch template.

            *   _(dict) --_

                Describes overrides for a launch template.

                *   **InstanceType** _(string) --_

                    The instance type.

                *   **MaxPrice** _(string) --_

                    The maximum price per unit hour that you are willing to pay for a Spot Instance.

                *   **SubnetId** _(string) --_

                    The IDs of the subnets in which to launch the instances. Separate multiple subnet IDs using commas (for example, subnet-1234abcdeexample1, subnet-0987cdef6example2 ). A request of type instant can have only one subnet ID.

                *   **AvailabilityZone** _(string) --_

                    The Availability Zone in which to launch the instances.

                *   **WeightedCapacity** _(float) --_

                    The number of units provided by the specified instance type.

                *   **Priority** _(float) --_

                    The priority for the launch template override. If **AllocationStrategy** is set to prioritized , EC2 Fleet uses priority to determine which launch template override to use first in fulfilling On-Demand capacity. The highest priority is launched first. Valid values are whole numbers starting at 0 . The lower the number, the higher the priority. If no number is set, the launch template override has the lowest priority.

                *   **Placement** _(dict) --_

                    The location where the instance launched, if applicable.

                    *   **AvailabilityZone** _(string) --_

                        The Availability Zone of the instance.

                        If not specified, an Availability Zone will be automatically chosen for you based on the load balancing criteria for the Region.

modify_hosts(kwargs_)

Modify the auto-placement setting of a Dedicated Host. When auto-placement is enabled, any instances that you launch with a tenancy of host but without a specific host ID are placed onto any available Dedicated Host in your account that has auto-placement enabled. When auto-placement is disabled, you need to provide a host ID to have the instance launch onto a specific host. If no host ID is provided, the instance is launched onto a suitable host with auto-placement enabled.

You can also use this API action to modify a Dedicated Host to support either multiple instance types in an instance family, or to support a specific instance type only.

modify_id_format(kwargs_)

Modifies the ID format for the specified resource on a per-Region basis. You can specify that resources should receive longer IDs (17-character IDs) when they are created.

This request can only be used to modify longer ID settings for resource types that are within the opt-in period. Resources currently in their opt-in period include: bundle | conversion-task | customer-gateway | dhcp-options | elastic-ip-allocation | elastic-ip-association | export-task | flow-log | image | import-task | internet-gateway | network-acl | network-acl-association | network-interface | network-interface-attachment | prefix-list | route-table | route-table-association | security-group | subnet | subnet-cidr-block-association | vpc | vpc-cidr-block-association | vpc-endpoint | vpc-peering-connection | vpn-connection | vpn-gateway .

This setting applies to the IAM user who makes the request; it does not apply to the entire AWS account. By default, an IAM user defaults to the same settings as the root user. If you're using this action as the root user, then these settings apply to the entire account, unless an IAM user explicitly overrides these settings for themselves. For more information, see [Resource IDs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/resource-ids.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

Resources created with longer IDs are visible to all IAM roles and users, regardless of these settings and provided that they have permission to use the relevant Describe command for the resource type.

modify_instance_placement(kwargs_)

Modifies the placement attributes for a specified instance. You can do the following:

*   Modify the affinity between an instance and a [Dedicated Host](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-hosts-overview.html) . When affinity is set to host and the instance is not associated with a specific Dedicated Host, the next time the instance is launched, it is automatically associated with the host on which it lands. If the instance is restarted or rebooted, this relationship persists.
*   Change the Dedicated Host with which an instance is associated.
*   Change the instance tenancy of an instance from host to dedicated , or from dedicated to host .
*   Move an instance to or from a [placement group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html) .

At least one attribute for affinity, host ID, tenancy, or placement group name must be specified in the request. Affinity and tenancy can be modified in the same request.

To modify the host ID, tenancy, placement group, or partition for an instance, the instance must be in the stopped state.

modify_spot_fleet_request(kwargs_)

Modifies the specified Spot Fleet request.

You can only modify a Spot Fleet request of type maintain .

While the Spot Fleet request is being modified, it is in the modifying state.

To scale up your Spot Fleet, increase its target capacity. The Spot Fleet launches the additional Spot Instances according to the allocation strategy for the Spot Fleet request. If the allocation strategy is lowestPrice , the Spot Fleet launches instances using the Spot Instance pool with the lowest price. If the allocation strategy is diversified , the Spot Fleet distributes the instances across the Spot Instance pools. If the allocation strategy is capacityOptimized , Spot Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances that are launching.

To scale down your Spot Fleet, decrease its target capacity. First, the Spot Fleet cancels any open requests that exceed the new target capacity. You can request that the Spot Fleet terminate Spot Instances until the size of the fleet no longer exceeds the new target capacity. If the allocation strategy is lowestPrice , the Spot Fleet terminates the instances with the highest price per unit. If the allocation strategy is capacityOptimized , the Spot Fleet terminates the instances in the Spot Instance pools that have the least available Spot Instance capacity. If the allocation strategy is diversified , the Spot Fleet terminates instances across the Spot Instance pools. Alternatively, you can request that the Spot Fleet keep the fleet at its current size, but not replace any Spot Instances that are interrupted or that you terminate manually.

If you are finished with your Spot Fleet for now, but will use it again later, you can set the target capacity to 0.

        Describes a launch template and overrides.

        *   **LaunchTemplateSpecification** _(dict) --_

            The launch template.

            *   **LaunchTemplateId** _(string) --_

                The ID of the launch template. If you specify the template ID, you can't specify the template name.

            *   **LaunchTemplateName** _(string) --_

                The name of the launch template. If you specify the template name, you can't specify the template ID.

            *   **Version** _(string) --_

                The launch template version number, $Latest , or $Default . You must specify a value, otherwise the request fails.

                If the value is $Latest , Amazon EC2 uses the latest version of the launch template.

                If the value is $Default , Amazon EC2 uses the default version of the launch template.

        *   **Overrides** _(list) --_

            Any parameters that you specify override the same parameters in the launch template.

            *   _(dict) --_

                *   **Priority** _(float) --_

                    The priority for the launch template override. If **OnDemandAllocationStrategy** is set to prioritized , Spot Fleet uses priority to determine which launch template override to use first in fulfilling On-Demand capacity. The highest priority is launched first. Valid values are whole numbers starting at 0 . The lower the number, the higher the priority. If no number is set, the launch template override has the lowest priority.

*   **SpotFleetRequestId** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The ID of the Spot Fleet request.

)

Parameters

*   **AssignIpv6AddressOnCreation** (_dict_) --

    Specify true to indicate that network interfaces created in the specified subnet should be assigned an IPv6 address. This includes a network interface that's created when launching an instance into the subnet (the instance therefore receives an IPv6 address).

    If you enable the IPv6 addressing feature for your subnet, your network interface or instance only receives an IPv6 address if it's created using version 2016-11-15 or later of the Amazon EC2 API.

    *   **Value** _(boolean) --_

        The attribute value. The valid values are true or false .

*   **MapPublicIpOnLaunch** (_dict_) --

    Specify true to indicate that network interfaces attached to instances created in the specified subnet should be assigned a public IPv4 address.

    *   **Value** _(boolean) --_

        The attribute value. The valid values are true or false .

*   **SubnetId** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The ID of the subnet.

*   **MapCustomerOwnedIpOnLaunch** (_dict_) --

    Specify true to indicate that network interfaces attached to instances created in the specified subnet should be assigned a customer-owned IPv4 address.

    When this value is true , you must specify the customer-owned IP pool using CustomerOwnedIpv4Pool .

    *   **Value** _(boolean) --_

        The attribute value. The valid values are true or false .

*   **CustomerOwnedIpv4Pool** (_string_) --

    The customer-owned IPv4 address pool associated with the subnet.

    You must set this value when you specify true for MapCustomerOwnedIpOnLaunch .


Returns

None

**Examples**

This example modifies the specified subnet so that all instances launched into this subnet are assigned a public IP address.

response = client.modify_subnet_attribute(
    MapPublicIpOnLaunch={
        'Value': True,
    },
    SubnetId='subnet-1a2b3c4d',
)

print(response)

Expected Output:

{
    'ResponseMetadata': {
        '...': '...',
    },
}

modify_traffic_mirror_filter_network_services(kwargs_)

Allows or restricts mirroring network services.

By default, Amazon DNS network services are not eligible for Traffic Mirror. Use AddNetworkServices to add network services to a Traffic Mirror filter. When a network service is added to the Traffic Mirror filter, all traffic related to that network service will be mirrored. When you no longer want to mirror network services, use RemoveNetworkServices to remove the network services from the Traffic Mirror filter.

For information about filter rule properties, see [Network Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/traffic-mirroring-considerations.html) in the _Traffic Mirroring User Guide_ .

modify_volume(kwargs_)

You can modify several parameters of an existing EBS volume, including volume size, volume type, and IOPS capacity. If your EBS volume is attached to a current-generation EC2 instance type, you might be able to apply these changes without stopping the instance or detaching the volume from it. For more information about modifying an EBS volume running Linux, see [Modifying the size, IOPS, or type of an EBS volume on Linux](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html) . For more information about modifying an EBS volume running Windows, see [Modifying the size, IOPS, or type of an EBS volume on Windows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html) .

When you complete a resize operation on your volume, you need to extend the volume's file-system size to take advantage of the new storage capacity. For information about extending a Linux file system, see [Extending a Linux file system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html#recognize-expanded-volume-linux) . For information about extending a Windows file system, see [Extending a Windows file system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html#recognize-expanded-volume-windows) .

You can use CloudWatch Events to check the status of a modification to an EBS volume. For information about CloudWatch Events, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/) . You can also track the status of a modification using DescribeVolumesModifications . For information about tracking status changes using either method, see [Monitoring volume modifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html#monitoring_mods) .

With previous-generation instance types, resizing an EBS volume might require detaching and reattaching the volume or stopping and restarting the instance. For more information, see [Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-modify-volume.html) (Linux) or [Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-modify-volume.html) (Windows).

If you reach the maximum volume modification rate per volume limit, you will need to wait at least six hours before applying further modifications to the affected EBS volume.

modify_volume_attribute(kwargs_)

Modifies a volume attribute.

By default, all I/O operations for the volume are suspended when the data on the volume is determined to be potentially inconsistent, to prevent undetectable, latent data corruption. The I/O access to the volume can be resumed by first enabling I/O access and then checking the data consistency on your volume.

You can change the default behavior to resume I/O operations. We recommend that you change this only for boot volumes or for volumes that are stateless or disposable.

modify_vpc_peering_connection_options(kwargs_)

Modifies the VPC peering connection options on one side of a VPC peering connection. You can do the following:

*   Enable/disable communication over the peering connection between an EC2-Classic instance that's linked to your VPC (using ClassicLink) and instances in the peer VPC.
*   Enable/disable communication over the peering connection between instances in your VPC and an EC2-Classic instance that's linked to the peer VPC.
*   Enable/disable the ability to resolve public DNS hostnames to private IP addresses when queried from instances in the peer VPC.

If the peered VPCs are in the same AWS account, you can enable DNS resolution for queries from the local VPC. This ensures that queries from the local VPC resolve to private IP addresses in the peer VPC. This option is not available if the peered VPCs are in different AWS accounts or different Regions. For peered VPCs in different AWS accounts, each AWS account owner must initiate a separate request to modify the peering connection options. For inter-region peering connections, you must use the Region for the requester VPC to modify the requester VPC peering options and the Region for the accepter VPC to modify the accepter VPC peering options. To verify which VPCs are the accepter and the requester for a VPC peering connection, use the DescribeVpcPeeringConnections command.

modify_vpn_connection(kwargs_)

Modifies the customer gateway or the target gateway of an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. To modify the target gateway, the following migration options are available:

*   An existing virtual private gateway to a new virtual private gateway
*   An existing virtual private gateway to a transit gateway
*   An existing transit gateway to a new transit gateway
*   An existing transit gateway to a virtual private gateway

Before you perform the migration to the new gateway, you must configure the new gateway. Use CreateVpnGateway to create a virtual private gateway, or CreateTransitGateway to create a transit gateway.

This step is required when you migrate from a virtual private gateway with static routes to a transit gateway.

You must delete the static routes before you migrate to the new gateway.

Keep a copy of the static route before you delete it. You will need to add back these routes to the transit gateway after the VPN connection migration is complete.

After you migrate to the new gateway, you might need to modify your VPC route table. Use CreateRoute and DeleteRoute to make the changes described in [VPN Gateway Target Modification Required VPC Route Table Updates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/modify-vpn-target.html#step-update-routing) in the _AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide_ .

When the new gateway is a transit gateway, modify the transit gateway route table to allow traffic between the VPC and the AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. Use CreateTransitGatewayRoute to add the routes.

If you deleted VPN static routes, you must add the static routes to the transit gateway route table.

After you perform this operation, the AWS VPN endpoint's IP addresses on the AWS side and the tunnel options remain intact. Your AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection will be temporarily unavailable for a brief period while we provision the new endpoints.

provision_byoip_cidr(kwargs_)

Provisions an IPv4 or IPv6 address range for use with your AWS resources through bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) and creates a corresponding address pool. After the address range is provisioned, it is ready to be advertised using AdvertiseByoipCidr .

AWS verifies that you own the address range and are authorized to advertise it. You must ensure that the address range is registered to you and that you created an RPKI ROA to authorize Amazon ASNs 16509 and 14618 to advertise the address range. For more information, see [Bring Your Own IP Addresses (BYOIP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

Provisioning an address range is an asynchronous operation, so the call returns immediately, but the address range is not ready to use until its status changes from pending-provision to provisioned . To monitor the status of an address range, use DescribeByoipCidrs . To allocate an Elastic IP address from your IPv4 address pool, use AllocateAddress with either the specific address from the address pool or the ID of the address pool.

reboot_instances(kwargs_)

Requests a reboot of the specified instances. This operation is asynchronous; it only queues a request to reboot the specified instances. The operation succeeds if the instances are valid and belong to you. Requests to reboot terminated instances are ignored.

If an instance does not cleanly shut down within a few minutes, Amazon EC2 performs a hard reboot.

For more information about troubleshooting, see [Getting console output and rebooting instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-console.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

See also: [AWS API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ec2-2016-11-15/RebootInstances)

**Request Syntax**

response = client.reboot_instances(
    InstanceIds=[
        'string',
    ],
    DryRun=True|False
)

Parameters

*   **InstanceIds** (_list_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    The instance IDs.

    *   _(string) --_
*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

Returns

None

**Examples**

This example reboots the specified EC2 instance.

response = client.reboot_instances(
    InstanceIds=[
        'i-1234567890abcdef5',
    ],
)

print(response)

Expected Output:

{
    'ResponseMetadata': {
        '...': '...',
    },
}

register_image(kwargs_)

Registers an AMI. When you're creating an AMI, this is the final step you must complete before you can launch an instance from the AMI. For more information about creating AMIs, see [Creating your own AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

Note

For Amazon EBS-backed instances, CreateImage creates and registers the AMI in a single request, so you don't have to register the AMI yourself.

You can also use RegisterImage to create an Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI from a snapshot of a root device volume. You specify the snapshot using the block device mapping. For more information, see [Launching a Linux instance from a backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-launch-snapshot.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

If any snapshots have AWS Marketplace product codes, they are copied to the new AMI.

Windows and some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), use the EC2 billing product code associated with an AMI to verify the subscription status for package updates. To create a new AMI for operating systems that require a billing product code, instead of registering the AMI, do the following to preserve the billing product code association:

*   Launch an instance from an existing AMI with that billing product code.
*   Customize the instance.
*   Create an AMI from the instance using CreateImage .

If you purchase a Reserved Instance to apply to an On-Demand Instance that was launched from an AMI with a billing product code, make sure that the Reserved Instance has the matching billing product code. If you purchase a Reserved Instance without the matching billing product code, the Reserved Instance will not be applied to the On-Demand Instance. For information about how to obtain the platform details and billing information of an AMI, see [Obtaining billing information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-billing-info.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

If needed, you can deregister an AMI at any time. Any modifications you make to an AMI backed by an instance store volume invalidates its registration. If you make changes to an image, deregister the previous image and register the new image.

Parameters

*   **ImageLocation** (_string_) -- The full path to your AMI manifest in Amazon S3 storage. The specified bucket must have the aws-exec-read canned access control list (ACL) to ensure that it can be accessed by Amazon EC2. For more information, see [Canned ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl) in the _Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide_ .
*   **Architecture** (_string_) --

    The architecture of the AMI.

    Default: For Amazon EBS-backed AMIs, i386 . For instance store-backed AMIs, the architecture specified in the manifest file.

*   **BlockDeviceMappings** (_list_) --

    The block device mapping entries.

    *   _(dict) --_

        Describes a block device mapping.

        *   **DeviceName** _(string) --_

            The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

        *   **VirtualName** _(string) --_

            The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1 . The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume.

            NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect.

            Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

        *   **Ebs** _(dict) --_

            Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched.

            *   **DeleteOnTermination** _(boolean) --_

                Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more information, see [Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance termination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html#preserving-volumes-on-termination) in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

            *   **Iops** _(integer) --_

                The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 , io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

                The following are the supported values for each volume type:

                *   gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS
                *   io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS
                *   io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for [Instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances) . Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

            *   **SnapshotId** _(string) --_

                The ID of the snapshot.

            *   **VolumeSize** _(integer) --_

                The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a volume size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot size.

                The following are the supported volumes sizes for each volume type:

                *   gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384
                *   io1 and io2 : 4-16,384
                *   st1 : 500-16,384
                *   sc1 : 500-16,384
                *   standard : 1-1,024
            *   **VolumeType** _(string) --_

                The volume type. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volume types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ . If the volume type is io1 or io2 , you must specify the IOPS that the volume supports.

            *   **KmsKeyId** _(string) --_

                Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN) for a customer managed CMK under which the EBS volume is encrypted.

                This parameter is only supported on BlockDeviceMapping objects called by [RunInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html) , [RequestSpotFleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotFleet.html) , and [RequestSpotInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotInstances.html) .

            *   **Throughput** _(integer) --_

                The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000.

            *   **Encrypted** _(boolean) --_

                Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see [Amazon EBS Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-parameters) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

                In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume.

                Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see [Supported instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption_supported_instances) .

                This parameter is not returned by .

*   **Name** (_string_) --

    **[REQUIRED]**

    A name for your AMI.

    Constraints: 3-128 alphanumeric characters, parentheses (()), square brackets ([]), spaces ( ), periods (.), slashes (/), dashes (-), single quotes ('), at-signs (@), or underscores(_)

*   **BillingProducts** (_list_) --

release_address(kwargs_)

Releases the specified Elastic IP address.

[EC2-Classic, default VPC] Releasing an Elastic IP address automatically disassociates it from any instance that it's associated with. To disassociate an Elastic IP address without releasing it, use DisassociateAddress .

[Nondefault VPC] You must use DisassociateAddress to disassociate the Elastic IP address before you can release it. Otherwise, Amazon EC2 returns an error (InvalidIPAddress.InUse ).

After releasing an Elastic IP address, it is released to the IP address pool. Be sure to update your DNS records and any servers or devices that communicate with the address. If you attempt to release an Elastic IP address that you already released, you'll get an AuthFailure error if the address is already allocated to another AWS account.

[EC2-VPC] After you release an Elastic IP address for use in a VPC, you might be able to recover it. For more information, see AllocateAddress .

See also: [AWS API Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ec2-2016-11-15/ReleaseAddress)

**Request Syntax**

response = client.release_address(
    AllocationId='string',
    PublicIp='string',
    NetworkBorderGroup='string',
    DryRun=True|False
)

Parameters

*   **AllocationId** (_string_) -- [EC2-VPC] The allocation ID. Required for EC2-VPC.
*   **PublicIp** (_string_) -- [EC2-Classic] The Elastic IP address. Required for EC2-Classic.
*   **NetworkBorderGroup** (_string_) --

    The set of Availability Zones, Local Zones, or Wavelength Zones from which AWS advertises IP addresses.

    If you provide an incorrect network border group, you will receive an InvalidAddress.NotFound error. For more information, see [Error Codes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/errors-overview.html) .

    Note

    You cannot use a network border group with EC2 Classic. If you attempt this operation on EC2 classic, you will receive an InvalidParameterCombination error. For more information, see [Error Codes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/errors-overview.html) .

*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

Returns

None

**Examples**

This example releases an Elastic IP address for use with instances in a VPC.

response = client.release_address(
    AllocationId='eipalloc-64d5890a',
)

print(response)

Expected Output:

{
    'ResponseMetadata': {
        '...': '...',
    },
}

This example releases an Elastic IP address for use with instances in EC2-Classic.

response = client.release_address(
    PublicIp='198.51.100.0',
)

print(response)

Expected Output:

{
    'ResponseMetadata': {
        '...': '...',
    },
}

release_hosts(kwargs_)

When you no longer want to use an On-Demand Dedicated Host it can be released. On-Demand billing is stopped and the host goes into released state. The host ID of Dedicated Hosts that have been released can no longer be specified in another request, for example, to modify the host. You must stop or terminate all instances on a host before it can be released.

When Dedicated Hosts are released, it may take some time for them to stop counting toward your limit and you may receive capacity errors when trying to allocate new Dedicated Hosts. Wait a few minutes and then try again.

Released hosts still appear in a DescribeHosts response.

report\_instance\_status(_\*\*kwargs_)

Submits feedback about the status of an instance. The instance must be in the running state. If your experience with the instance differs from the instance status returned by DescribeInstanceStatus , use ReportInstanceStatus to report your experience with the instance. Amazon EC2 collects this information to improve the accuracy of status checks.

Use of this action does not change the value returned by DescribeInstanceStatus .

request\_spot\_fleet(_\*\*kwargs_)

Creates a Spot Fleet request.

The Spot Fleet request specifies the total target capacity and the On-Demand target capacity. Amazon EC2 calculates the difference between the total capacity and On-Demand capacity, and launches the difference as Spot capacity.

You can submit a single request that includes multiple launch specifications that vary by instance type, AMI, Availability Zone, or subnet.

By default, the Spot Fleet requests Spot Instances in the Spot Instance pool where the price per unit is the lowest. Each launch specification can include its own instance weighting that reflects the value of the instance type to your application workload.

Alternatively, you can specify that the Spot Fleet distribute the target capacity across the Spot pools included in its launch specifications. By ensuring that the Spot Instances in your Spot Fleet are in different Spot pools, you can improve the availability of your fleet.

You can specify tags for the Spot Fleet request and instances launched by the fleet. You cannot tag other resource types in a Spot Fleet request because only the spot-fleet-request and instance resource types are supported.

For more information, see [Spot Fleet requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-requests.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances_ .

Parameters

*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **SpotFleetRequestConfig** (_dict_) --

    **\[REQUIRED\]**

    The configuration for the Spot Fleet request.

    *   **AllocationStrategy** _(string) --_

        Indicates how to allocate the target Spot Instance capacity across the Spot Instance pools specified by the Spot Fleet request.

        If the allocation strategy is lowestPrice , Spot Fleet launches instances from the Spot Instance pools with the lowest price. This is the default allocation strategy.

        If the allocation strategy is diversified , Spot Fleet launches instances from all the Spot Instance pools that you specify.

        If the allocation strategy is capacityOptimized , Spot Fleet launches instances from Spot Instance pools with optimal capacity for the number of instances that are launching.

    *   **OnDemandAllocationStrategy** _(string) --_

        The order of the launch template overrides to use in fulfilling On-Demand capacity. If you specify lowestPrice , Spot Fleet uses price to determine the order, launching the lowest price first. If you specify prioritized , Spot Fleet uses the priority that you assign to each Spot Fleet launch template override, launching the highest priority first. If you do not specify a value, Spot Fleet defaults to lowestPrice .

    *   **SpotMaintenanceStrategies** _(dict) --_

        The strategies for managing your Spot Instances that are at an elevated risk of being interrupted.

        *   **CapacityRebalance** _(dict) --_

            The strategy to use when Amazon EC2 emits a signal that your Spot Instance is at an elevated risk of being interrupted.

            *   **ReplacementStrategy** _(string) --_

                The replacement strategy to use. Only available for fleets of type maintain . You must specify a value, otherwise you get an error.

                To allow Spot Fleet to launch a replacement Spot Instance when an instance rebalance notification is emitted for a Spot Instance in the fleet, specify launch .

                Note

                When a replacement instance is launched, the instance marked for rebalance is not automatically terminated. You can terminate it, or you can leave it running. You are charged for all instances while they are running.

    *   **ClientToken** _(string) --_

        A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of your listings. This helps to avoid duplicate listings. For more information, see [Ensuring Idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html) .

    *   **ExcessCapacityTerminationPolicy** _(string) --_

        Indicates whether running Spot Instances should be terminated if you decrease the target capacity of the Spot Fleet request below the current size of the Spot Fleet.

    *   **FulfilledCapacity** _(float) --_

        The number of units fulfilled by this request compared to the set target capacity. You cannot set this value.

    *   **OnDemandFulfilledCapacity** _(float) --_

        The number of On-Demand units fulfilled by this request compared to the set target On-Demand capacity.

    *   **IamFleetRole** _(string) --_ **\[REQUIRED\]**

        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that grants the Spot Fleet the permission to request, launch, terminate, and tag instances on your behalf. For more information, see [Spot Fleet prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet-requests.html#spot-fleet-prerequisites) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances_ . Spot Fleet can terminate Spot Instances on your behalf when you cancel its Spot Fleet request using [CancelSpotFleetRequests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CancelSpotFleetRequests) or when the Spot Fleet request expires, if you set TerminateInstancesWithExpiration .

    *   **LaunchSpecifications** _(list) --_

        The launch specifications for the Spot Fleet request. If you specify LaunchSpecifications , you can't specify LaunchTemplateConfigs . If you include On-Demand capacity in your request, you must use LaunchTemplateConfigs .

        *   _(dict) --_

            Describes the launch specification for one or more Spot Instances. If you include On-Demand capacity in your fleet request or want to specify an EFA network device, you can't use SpotFleetLaunchSpecification ; you must use [LaunchTemplateConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_LaunchTemplateConfig.html) .

            *   **SecurityGroups** _(list) --_

                One or more security groups. When requesting instances in a VPC, you must specify the IDs of the security groups. When requesting instances in EC2-Classic, you can specify the names or the IDs of the security groups.

                *   _(dict) --_

                    Describes a security group.

                    *   **GroupName** _(string) --_

                        The name of the security group.

                    *   **GroupId** _(string) --_

                        The ID of the security group.

            *   **AddressingType** _(string) --_

                Deprecated.

            *   **BlockDeviceMappings** _(list) --_

                One or more block devices that are mapped to the Spot Instances. You can't specify both a snapshot ID and an encryption value. This is because only blank volumes can be encrypted on creation. If a snapshot is the basis for a volume, it is not blank and its encryption status is used for the volume encryption status.

                *   _(dict) --_

                    Describes a block device mapping.

                    *   **DeviceName** _(string) --_

                        The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

                    *   **VirtualName** _(string) --_

                        The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1 . The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume.

                        NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect.

                        Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

                    *   **Ebs** _(dict) --_

                        Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched.

                        *   **DeleteOnTermination** _(boolean) --_

                            Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more information, see [Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance termination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html#preserving-volumes-on-termination) in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

                        *   **Iops** _(integer) --_

                            The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 , io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

                            The following are the supported values for each volume type:

                            *   gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS
                            *   io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS
                            *   io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                            For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for [Instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances) . Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

**Examples**

This example creates a Spot fleet request with two launch specifications that differ only by subnet. The Spot fleet launches the instances in the specified subnet with the lowest price. If the instances are launched in a default VPC, they receive a public IP address by default. If the instances are launched in a nondefault VPC, they do not receive a public IP address by default. Note that you can't specify different subnets from the same Availability Zone in a Spot fleet request.

This example creates a Spot fleet request with two launch specifications that differ only by Availability Zone. The Spot fleet launches the instances in the specified Availability Zone with the lowest price. If your account supports EC2-VPC only, Amazon EC2 launches the Spot instances in the default subnet of the Availability Zone. If your account supports EC2-Classic, Amazon EC2 launches the instances in EC2-Classic in the Availability Zone.

Parameters

*   **AvailabilityZoneGroup** (_string_) --

    The user-specified name for a logical grouping of requests.

    When you specify an Availability Zone group in a Spot Instance request, all Spot Instances in the request are launched in the same Availability Zone. Instance proximity is maintained with this parameter, but the choice of Availability Zone is not. The group applies only to requests for Spot Instances of the same instance type. Any additional Spot Instance requests that are specified with the same Availability Zone group name are launched in that same Availability Zone, as long as at least one instance from the group is still active.

    If there is no active instance running in the Availability Zone group that you specify for a new Spot Instance request (all instances are terminated, the request is expired, or the maximum price you specified falls below current Spot price), then Amazon EC2 launches the instance in any Availability Zone where the constraint can be met. Consequently, the subsequent set of Spot Instances could be placed in a different zone from the original request, even if you specified the same Availability Zone group.

    Default: Instances are launched in any available Availability Zone.

*   **BlockDurationMinutes** (_integer_) --

    The required duration for the Spot Instances (also known as Spot blocks), in minutes. This value must be a multiple of 60 (60, 120, 180, 240, 300, or 360).

    The duration period starts as soon as your Spot Instance receives its instance ID. At the end of the duration period, Amazon EC2 marks the Spot Instance for termination and provides a Spot Instance termination notice, which gives the instance a two-minute warning before it terminates.

    You can't specify an Availability Zone group or a launch group if you specify a duration.

    New accounts or accounts with no previous billing history with AWS are not eligible for Spot Instances with a defined duration (also known as Spot blocks).

*   **ClientToken** (_string_) -- Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see [How to Ensure Idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html) in the _Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances_ .
*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .
*   **InstanceCount** (_integer_) --

    The maximum number of Spot Instances to launch.

    Default: 1

*   **LaunchGroup** (_string_) --

    The instance launch group. Launch groups are Spot Instances that launch together and terminate together.

    Default: Instances are launched and terminated individually

*   **LaunchSpecification** (_dict_) --

    The launch specification.

    *   **SecurityGroupIds** _(list) --_

        One or more security group IDs.

        *   _(string) --_
    *   **SecurityGroups** _(list) --_

        One or more security groups. When requesting instances in a VPC, you must specify the IDs of the security groups. When requesting instances in EC2-Classic, you can specify the names or the IDs of the security groups.

        *   _(string) --_
    *   **AddressingType** _(string) --_

        Deprecated.

    *   **BlockDeviceMappings** _(list) --_

        One or more block device mapping entries. You can't specify both a snapshot ID and an encryption value. This is because only blank volumes can be encrypted on creation. If a snapshot is the basis for a volume, it is not blank and its encryption status is used for the volume encryption status.

        *   _(dict) --_

            Describes a block device mapping.

            *   **DeviceName** _(string) --_

                The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

            *   **VirtualName** _(string) --_

                The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1 . The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume.

                NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect.

                Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

            *   **Ebs** _(dict) --_

                Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched.

                *   **DeleteOnTermination** _(boolean) --_

                    Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more information, see [Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance termination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html#preserving-volumes-on-termination) in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

                *   **Iops** _(integer) --_

                    The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 , io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

                    The following are the supported values for each volume type:

                    *   gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS
                    *   io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS
                    *   io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                    For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for [Instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances) . Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                    This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                *   **SnapshotId** _(string) --_

                    The ID of the snapshot.

                *   **VolumeSize** _(integer) --_

                    The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a volume size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot size.

                    The following are the supported volumes sizes for each volume type:

                    *   gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384
                    *   io1 and io2 : 4-16,384
                    *   st1 : 500-16,384
                    *   sc1 : 500-16,384
                    *   standard : 1-1,024
                *   **VolumeType** _(string) --_

                    The volume type. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volume types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ . If the volume type is io1 or io2 , you must specify the IOPS that the volume supports.

                *   **KmsKeyId** _(string) --_

                    Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN) for a customer managed CMK under which the EBS volume is encrypted.

                    This parameter is only supported on BlockDeviceMapping objects called by [RunInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html) , [RequestSpotFleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotFleet.html) , and [RequestSpotInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotInstances.html) .

                *   **Throughput** _(integer) --_

                    The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                    This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                    Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000.

                *   **Encrypted** _(boolean) --_

                    Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see [Amazon EBS Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-parameters) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

                    In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume.

                    Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see [Supported instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption_supported_instances) .

                    This parameter is not returned by .

            *   **NoDevice** _(string) --_

                Suppresses the specified device included in the block device mapping of the AMI.

    *   **EbsOptimized** _(boolean) --_

        Indicates whether the instance is optimized for EBS I/O. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal EBS I/O performance. This optimization isn't available with all instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an EBS Optimized instance.

        Default: false

    *   **IamInstanceProfile** _(dict) --_

        The IAM instance profile.

        *   **Arn** _(string) --_

            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance profile.

        *   **Name** _(string) --_

            The name of the instance profile.

    *   **ImageId** _(string) --_

        The ID of the AMI.

    *   **InstanceType** _(string) --_

        The instance type.

    *   **KernelId** _(string) --_

        The ID of the kernel.

    *   **KeyName** _(string) --_

        The name of the key pair.

    *   **Monitoring** _(dict) --_

        Indicates whether basic or detailed monitoring is enabled for the instance.

        Default: Disabled

        *   **Enabled** _(boolean) --_ **\[REQUIRED\]**

            Indicates whether detailed monitoring is enabled. Otherwise, basic monitoring is enabled.

    *   **NetworkInterfaces** _(list) --_

        One or more network interfaces. If you specify a network interface, you must specify subnet IDs and security group IDs using the network interface.

        *   _(dict) --_

            Describes a network interface.

            *   **AssociatePublicIpAddress** _(boolean) --_

                Indicates whether to assign a public IPv4 address to an instance you launch in a VPC.

                            The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1 . The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume.

                            NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect.

                            Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

                                The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 , io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

                                The following are the supported values for each volume type:

                                *   gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS
                                *   io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS
                                *   io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                                For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for [Instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances) . Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                                This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

                            *   **Encrypted** _(boolean) --_

                                Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see [Amazon EBS Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-parameters) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

                                In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume.

                                Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see [Supported instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption_supported_instances) .

revoke\_security\_group\_egress(_\*\*kwargs_)

\[VPC only\] Removes the specified egress rules from a security group for EC2-VPC. This action does not apply to security groups for use in EC2-Classic. To remove a rule, the values that you specify (for example, ports) must match the existing rule's values exactly.

Note

\[Default VPC\] If the values you specify do not match the existing rule's values, no error is returned, and the output describes the security group rules that were not revoked.

AWS recommends that you use DescribeSecurityGroups to verify that the rule has been removed.

Each rule consists of the protocol and the IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR range or source security group. For the TCP and UDP protocols, you must also specify the destination port or range of ports. For the ICMP protocol, you must also specify the ICMP type and code. If the security group rule has a description, you do not have to specify the description to revoke the rule.

Rule changes are propagated to instances within the security group as quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.

revoke\_security\_group\_ingress(_\*\*kwargs_)

Removes the specified ingress rules from a security group. To remove a rule, the values that you specify (for example, ports) must match the existing rule's values exactly.

Note

\[EC2-Classic , default VPC\] If the values you specify do not match the existing rule's values, no error is returned, and the output describes the security group rules that were not revoked.

AWS recommends that you use DescribeSecurityGroups to verify that the rule has been removed.

Each rule consists of the protocol and the CIDR range or source security group. For the TCP and UDP protocols, you must also specify the destination port or range of ports. For the ICMP protocol, you must also specify the ICMP type and code. If the security group rule has a description, you do not have to specify the description to revoke the rule.

Rule changes are propagated to instances within the security group as quickly as possible. However, a small delay might occur.

run\_instances(_\*\*kwargs_)

Launches the specified number of instances using an AMI for which you have permissions.

You can specify a number of options, or leave the default options. The following rules apply:

*   \[EC2-VPC\] If you don't specify a subnet ID, we choose a default subnet from your default VPC for you. If you don't have a default VPC, you must specify a subnet ID in the request.
*   \[EC2-Classic\] If don't specify an Availability Zone, we choose one for you.
*   Some instance types must be launched into a VPC. If you do not have a default VPC, or if you do not specify a subnet ID, the request fails. For more information, see [Instance types available only in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html#vpc-only-instance-types) .
*   \[EC2-VPC\] All instances have a network interface with a primary private IPv4 address. If you don't specify this address, we choose one from the IPv4 range of your subnet.
*   Not all instance types support IPv6 addresses. For more information, see [Instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html) .
*   If you don't specify a security group ID, we use the default security group. For more information, see [Security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html) .
*   If any of the AMIs have a product code attached for which the user has not subscribed, the request fails.

You can create a [launch template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html) , which is a resource that contains the parameters to launch an instance. When you launch an instance using RunInstances , you can specify the launch template instead of specifying the launch parameters.

To ensure faster instance launches, break up large requests into smaller batches. For example, create five separate launch requests for 100 instances each instead of one launch request for 500 instances.

An instance is ready for you to use when it's in the running state. You can check the state of your instance using DescribeInstances . You can tag instances and EBS volumes during launch, after launch, or both. For more information, see CreateTags and [Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html) .

Linux instances have access to the public key of the key pair at boot. You can use this key to provide secure access to the instance. Amazon EC2 public images use this feature to provide secure access without passwords. For more information, see [Key pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

For troubleshooting, see [What to do if an instance immediately terminates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_InstanceStraightToTerminated.html) , and [Troubleshooting connecting to your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

Parameters

*   **BlockDeviceMappings** (_list_) --

    The block device mapping entries.

    *   _(dict) --_

        Describes a block device mapping.

        *   **DeviceName** _(string) --_

            The device name (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh ).

        *   **VirtualName** _(string) --_

            The virtual device name (ephemeral N). Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance store volumes can specify mappings for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1 . The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance type. After you connect to the instance, you must mount the volume.

            NVMe instance store volumes are automatically enumerated and assigned a device name. Including them in your block device mapping has no effect.

            Constraints: For M3 instances, you must specify instance store volumes in the block device mapping for the instance. When you launch an M3 instance, we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI.

        *   **Ebs** _(dict) --_

            Parameters used to automatically set up EBS volumes when the instance is launched.

            *   **DeleteOnTermination** _(boolean) --_

                Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination. For more information, see [Preserving Amazon EBS volumes on instance termination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html#preserving-volumes-on-termination) in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

            *   **Iops** _(integer) --_

                The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3 , io1 , and io2 volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

                The following are the supported values for each volume type:

                *   gp3 : 3,000-16,000 IOPS
                *   io1 : 100-64,000 IOPS
                *   io2 : 100-64,000 IOPS

                For io1 and io2 volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for [Instances built on the Nitro System](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances) . Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

                This parameter is required for io1 and io2 volumes. The default for gp3 volumes is 3,000 IOPS. This parameter is not supported for gp2 , st1 , sc1 , or standard volumes.

            *   **SnapshotId** _(string) --_

                The ID of the snapshot.

            *   **VolumeSize** _(integer) --_

                The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a volume size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot size.

                The following are the supported volumes sizes for each volume type:

                *   gp2 and gp3 :1-16,384
                *   io1 and io2 : 4-16,384
                *   st1 : 500-16,384
                *   sc1 : 500-16,384
                *   standard : 1-1,024
            *   **VolumeType** _(string) --_

                The volume type. For more information, see [Amazon EBS volume types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ . If the volume type is io1 or io2 , you must specify the IOPS that the volume supports.

            *   **KmsKeyId** _(string) --_

                Identifier (key ID, key alias, ID ARN, or alias ARN) for a customer managed CMK under which the EBS volume is encrypted.

                This parameter is only supported on BlockDeviceMapping objects called by [RunInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html) , [RequestSpotFleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotFleet.html) , and [RequestSpotInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotInstances.html) .

            *   **Throughput** _(integer) --_

                The throughput that the volume supports, in MiB/s.

                This parameter is valid only for gp3 volumes.

                Valid Range: Minimum value of 125. Maximum value of 1000.

            *   **Encrypted** _(boolean) --_

                Indicates whether the encryption state of an EBS volume is changed while being restored from a backing snapshot. The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on the volume origin (new or from a snapshot), starting encryption state, ownership, and whether encryption by default is enabled. For more information, see [Amazon EBS Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-parameters) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

                In no case can you remove encryption from an encrypted volume.

                Encrypted volumes can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see [Supported instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#EBSEncryption_supported_instances) .

                This parameter is not returned by .

        *   **NoDevice** _(string) --_

            Suppresses the specified device included in the block device mapping of the AMI.

*   **ImageId** (_string_) -- The ID of the AMI. An AMI ID is required to launch an instance and must be specified here or in a launch template.
*   **InstanceType** (_string_) --

    The instance type. For more information, see [Instance types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

    Default: m1.small

*   **Ipv6AddressCount** (_integer_) --

    \[EC2-VPC\] The number of IPv6 addresses to associate with the primary network interface. Amazon EC2 chooses the IPv6 addresses from the range of your subnet. You cannot specify this option and the option to assign specific IPv6 addresses in the same request. You can specify this option if you've specified a minimum number of instances to launch.

    You cannot specify this option and the network interfaces option in the same request.

*   **Ipv6Addresses** (_list_) --

    \[EC2-VPC\] The IPv6 addresses from the range of the subnet to associate with the primary network interface. You cannot specify this option and the option to assign a number of IPv6 addresses in the same request. You cannot specify this option if you've specified a minimum number of instances to launch.

    You cannot specify this option and the network interfaces option in the same request.

    *   _(dict) --_

        Describes an IPv6 address.

        *   **Ipv6Address** _(string) --_

            The IPv6 address.

*   **KernelId** (_string_) --

    The ID of the kernel.

    Warning

    We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see [PV-GRUB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedkernels.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

    Warning

    If you do not specify a key pair, you can't connect to the instance unless you choose an AMI that is configured to allow users another way to log in.

*   **MaxCount** (_integer_) --

    **\[REQUIRED\]**

    The maximum number of instances to launch. If you specify more instances than Amazon EC2 can launch in the target Availability Zone, Amazon EC2 launches the largest possible number of instances above MinCount .

    Constraints: Between 1 and the maximum number you're allowed for the specified instance type. For more information about the default limits, and how to request an increase, see [How many instances can I run in Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#How_many_instances_can_I_run_in_Amazon_EC2) in the Amazon EC2 FAQ.

*   **MinCount** (_integer_) --

    **\[REQUIRED\]**

send\_diagnostic\_interrupt(_\*\*kwargs_)

Sends a diagnostic interrupt to the specified Amazon EC2 instance to trigger a _kernel panic_ (on Linux instances), or a _blue screen_ /_stop error_ (on Windows instances). For instances based on Intel and AMD processors, the interrupt is received as a _non-maskable interrupt_ (NMI).

In general, the operating system crashes and reboots when a kernel panic or stop error is triggered. The operating system can also be configured to perform diagnostic tasks, such as generating a memory dump file, loading a secondary kernel, or obtaining a call trace.

Before sending a diagnostic interrupt to your instance, ensure that its operating system is configured to perform the required diagnostic tasks.

For more information about configuring your operating system to generate a crash dump when a kernel panic or stop error occurs, see [Send a diagnostic interrupt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/diagnostic-interrupt.html) (Linux instances) or [Send a Diagnostic Interrupt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/diagnostic-interrupt.html) (Windows instances).

**Request Syntax**

response \= client.send\_diagnostic\_interrupt(
    InstanceId\='string',
    DryRun\=True|False
)

Parameters

*   **InstanceId** (_string_) --

    **\[REQUIRED\]**

    The ID of the instance.

*   **DryRun** (_boolean_) -- Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation . Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation .

Returns

None

start\_instances(_\*\*kwargs_)

Starts an Amazon EBS-backed instance that you've previously stopped.

Instances that use Amazon EBS volumes as their root devices can be quickly stopped and started. When an instance is stopped, the compute resources are released and you are not billed for instance usage. However, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. You can restart your instance at any time. Every time you start your Windows instance, Amazon EC2 charges you for a full instance hour. If you stop and restart your Windows instance, a new instance hour begins and Amazon EC2 charges you for another full instance hour even if you are still within the same 60-minute period when it was stopped. Every time you start your Linux instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage.

Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM.

Performing this operation on an instance that uses an instance store as its root device returns an error.

For more information, see [Stopping instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

**Response Structure**

*   _(dict) --_

    *   **StartingInstances** _(list) --_

        Information about the started instances.

        *   _(dict) --_

            Describes an instance state change.

            *   **CurrentState** _(dict) --_

                The current state of the instance.

                *   **Code** _(integer) --_

                    The state of the instance as a 16-bit unsigned integer.

                    The high byte is all of the bits between 2^8 and (2^16)-1, which equals decimal values between 256 and 65,535. These numerical values are used for internal purposes and should be ignored.

                    The low byte is all of the bits between 2^0 and (2^8)-1, which equals decimal values between 0 and 255.

                    The valid values for instance-state-code will all be in the range of the low byte and they are:

                    *   0 : pending
                    *   16 : running
                    *   32 : shutting-down
                    *   48 : terminated
                    *   64 : stopping
                    *   80 : stopped

                    You can ignore the high byte value by zeroing out all of the bits above 2^8 or 256 in decimal.

                *   **Name** _(string) --_

                    The current state of the instance.

            *   **InstanceId** _(string) --_

                The ID of the instance.

            *   **PreviousState** _(dict) --_

                The previous state of the instance.

                *   **Code** _(integer) --_

                    The state of the instance as a 16-bit unsigned integer.

                    The high byte is all of the bits between 2^8 and (2^16)-1, which equals decimal values between 256 and 65,535. These numerical values are used for internal purposes and should be ignored.

                    *   48 : terminated
                    *   64 : stopping
                    *   80 : stopped

                    You can ignore the high byte value by zeroing out all of the bits above 2^8 or 256 in decimal.

                *   **Name** _(string) --_

                    The current state of the instance.

start\_vpc\_endpoint\_service\_private\_dns\_verification(_\*\*kwargs_)to this definition")

Initiates the verification process to prove that the service provider owns the private DNS name domain for the endpoint service.

The service provider must successfully perform the verification before the consumer can use the name to access the service.

Before the service provider runs this command, they must add a record to the DNS server. For more information, see [Adding a TXT Record to Your Domain's DNS Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/endpoint-services-dns-validation.html#add-dns-txt-record) in the _Amazon VPC User Guide_ .

stop\_instances(_\*\*kwargs_)

Stops an Amazon EBS-backed instance.

You can use the Stop action to hibernate an instance if the instance is [enabled for hibernation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html#enabling-hibernation) and it meets the [hibernation prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html#hibernating-prerequisites) . For more information, see [Hibernate your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

We don't charge usage for a stopped instance, or data transfer fees; however, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. Every time you start your Windows instance, Amazon EC2 charges you for a full instance hour. If you stop and restart your Windows instance, a new instance hour begins and Amazon EC2 charges you for another full instance hour even if you are still within the same 60-minute period when it was stopped. Every time you start your Linux instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage.

You can't stop or hibernate instance store-backed instances. You can't use the Stop action to hibernate Spot Instances, but you can specify that Amazon EC2 should hibernate Spot Instances when they are interrupted. For more information, see [Hibernating interrupted Spot Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-interruptions.html#hibernate-spot-instances) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

When you stop or hibernate an instance, we shut it down. You can restart your instance at any time. Before stopping or hibernating an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM, but hibernating an instance does preserve data stored in RAM. If an instance cannot hibernate successfully, a normal shutdown occurs.

Stopping and hibernating an instance is different to rebooting or terminating it. For example, when you stop or hibernate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached during the instance launch are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between rebooting, stopping, hibernating, and terminating instances, see [Instance lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

When you stop an instance, we attempt to shut it down forcibly after a short while. If your instance appears stuck in the stopping state after a period of time, there may be an issue with the underlying host computer. For more information, see [Troubleshooting stopping your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesStopping.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

terminate\_instances(_\*\*kwargs_)

Shuts down the specified instances. This operation is idempotent; if you terminate an instance more than once, each call succeeds.

If you specify multiple instances and the request fails (for example, because of a single incorrect instance ID), none of the instances are terminated.

Terminated instances remain visible after termination (for approximately one hour).

By default, Amazon EC2 deletes all EBS volumes that were attached when the instance launched. Volumes attached after instance launch continue running.

You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only terminate instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance differs if you stop it or terminate it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, any attached EBS volumes with the DeleteOnTermination block device mapping parameter set to true are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between stopping and terminating instances, see [Instance lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html) in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_ .

withdraw\_byoip\_cidr(_\*\*kwargs_)

Stops advertising an address range that is provisioned as an address pool.

You can perform this operation at most once every 10 seconds, even if you specify different address ranges each time.

It can take a few minutes before traffic to the specified addresses stops routing to AWS because of BGP propagation delays.
