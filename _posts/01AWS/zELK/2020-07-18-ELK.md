# The ELK stack

The ELK stack is an acronym used to describe a stack that comprises of 3 open-source projects: `Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana`.
- Often referred to as `Elasticsearch`
- the ELK stack can:
  - aggregate logs from all systems and applications,
  - analyze these logs,
  - create visualizations for application and infrastructure monitoring,
  - faster troubleshooting,
  - security analytics, and more.


ELK stack fulfills a need in the log analytics space.
- a log management and analytics solution to `monitor this infrastructure` and `process any server logs, application logs, and clickstreams`.
- a simple yet robust log analysis solution for developers and DevOps engineers to gain valuable insights on failure diagnosis, application performance, and infrastructure monitoring
- can choose to deploy and manage the ELK stack yourself.
  - scaling up and down to meet business requirements or achieving security and compliance is a challenge with the self-managed option.
- Or choose <kbd>Amazon Elasticsearch Service</kbd>
  - fully managed service
  - deploy, secure, and operate Elasticsearch at scale.
  - offers support for Elasticsearch APIs, built-in Kibana, and integration with Logstash
  - can continue to use existing tools and code
  - Amazon Elasticsearch Service also integrates with other AWS services such as `Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, and AWS IoT` giving you the flexibility to select the data ingestion tool that meets use case requirements.

ELK

- **Logstash**
  - Data collection and transportation pipeline. We will use Logstash to read in our syslog files and store them in an Elasticsearch index.
- **Elasticsearch**
  - A distributed search and analytics engine designed for scalability. This is what indexes our data and allows us to create usability visualizations with Kibana.
- **Kibana**
  - a data visualization platform that is easy to use and nice on the eyes.


The data lifecycle for ELK goes a little something like this:
1. `Syslog Server` feeds `Logstash`
2. `Logstash` filters and parses logs and stores them within `Elasticsearch`
3. `Elasticsearch` indexes and makes sense out of all the data
4. `Kibana` makes millions of data points consumable by us mere mortals
