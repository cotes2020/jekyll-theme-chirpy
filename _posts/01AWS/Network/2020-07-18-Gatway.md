# Gateway


Gateway terminology:
- Internet Gateway (IGW) – AWS VPC side of the connection to the public Internet.
- Network address translation Gateway (NAT)
- Virtual private Gateway (VPG) – VPC endpoint on the AWS side.
- Customer Gateway (CGW) – representation of the customer end of the connection.
- Egress-Only Gateway

## Virtual private Gateway
1. A virtual private Gateway is <font color=red> HA by design </font>
2. Only <font color=red> one VGW can be associated with a VPC </font>

When would a virtual private Gateway be used
- <font color=red> when a VPC connects to a Private VIF with Direct Connect </font>
  - connects a VPC to a Private VIF (in conjunction with Direct Connect) for direct private connectivity from on on-premise site.
- <font color=red> when needing to attach to multiple VPN connections </font>
  - VPG act as the termination point for many different VPN connections.
- <font color=red> when using a VPN connection between a customer Gateway and a VPC </font>
  - VPN connection occurs between the customer Gateway and the virtual private Gateway.
  - The VPG acts as the <font color=blue> endpoint for VPN tunnels </font>



---

## Customer Gateway

- one customer Gateway per VPN tunnel
- one public IP address per customer Gateway.
- AWS provides two tunnel destinations per Region.
- have to maintain unique IP addresses on your end and on your route.

## VPN hub-and-spoke architecture

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rK3d5YH.png" width="600">

- EC2 VPN instances to the central customer Gateway.
- two EC2-based VPN endpoints in each spoke to support high availability.
- a central VPC (hub) that contains common services for all application VPCs.
- a dynamic routing protocol between the spokes and the hub.

## Egress-Only Gateway


- require a private subnet on IPv6-enabled VPCs, the Egress-only Internet Gateway, to allow <font color=red> one-way access to internet resources </font>
  - With the Egress-only Internet Gateway, outgoing traffic to the internet will be allowed. However, incoming traffic that’s initiated from the internet will be blocked.
  - no additional charge to use the Egress-only Internet Gateways.
  - However, data transfer charges apply.

- IPv6 addresses are globally unique and are therefore public by default.
  - Must create a custom route for `::/0` to the Egress-Only Internet Gateway.
  - Use Egress-Only Internet Gateway instead of NAT for IPv6.

- Stateful
  - forwards traffic from instance to Internet and then sends back the response.

- allows IPv6 traffic from instances to the Internet.
  - does accept inbound traffic, but it is a certain type of inbound traffic.

- Prevents inbound access to those IPv6 instances.
  - Internet initiated traffic to those instances is blocked.
- Provides outbound Internet access for IPv6 addressed instances.

## AD Connector
- AD Connector is a directory gateway
- can redirect directory requests to your on-premises Microsoft Active Directory without caching any information in the cloud

## how subnets, Gateways, and routes work together.
- This diagram, we have two Availability Zones, two instances and private subnets, the NAT instance with the public IP address, and the public subnet.
- have an internet Gateway connected to the VPC.
- have a NAT instance, it needs a route to the internet Gateway so that the instance can talk to the internet.
  - the internet is in the route table, as indicated by the 0.0.0.0/0 address.
  - The targets that use the internet Gateway have the local route group, 10.0.0.0/20 address.
- to let private subnet connect to the internet
  - go through the NAT instance.
  - The 0.0.0.0 address indicates that it must route to the NAT.
  - The NAT will route the request to the Internet.
- The second private instance currently has no route.
  - If that instance needs to go to the internet,
  - a route needs to be created to the NAT instance with the public IP address 0.0.0.0/0 with the target of NAT.
  - This will enable the private instances to access the internet
- You can further tighten security using security groups.
  - a security group for the two private instances.
  - a security group for the public NAT group.
  - The security groups and the route tables helps control traffic within the VPC.
- The diagram also contains a DynamoDB instance
  - sits outside of the VPC, but in the same Region as the VPC.
  - Traffic could be routed to it via the internet Gateway.
  - there will be some services that reside outside of your VPC. One of those services is DynamoDB.
