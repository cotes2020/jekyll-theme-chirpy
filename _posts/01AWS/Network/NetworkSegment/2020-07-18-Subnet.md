# Subnet

- a range of IP addresses in a VPC.
- A subsection, segments, or partitions of a network. Divided by CIDR range.
- **Subnets can only belong to a single Availability Zone**.
  - can't span across Availability Zones.
- Subnets are generally classified as public or private.
  - Public subnets have direct access to the internet
  - private subnet do not.


- Subnets should be used to define which parts of the network are accessible to the internet, and which parts are not.

  - Rather than defining subnets based on application or functional tier—such as web, application, data, etc.
  - it’s recommended that organize subnets based on internet accessibility.
  - to define clear, subnet-level isolation between public and private resources.




## IP addressing
- When create VPC, specify its set of IP addresses with <font color=red> Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation </font>
  - IP addresses enable resources in VPC to communicate with each other and with resources over the internet.
  - After create a VPC, cannot change the address range
  - CIDR notation: a simplified way to show a specific range of IP addresses.
    - example: 10.0.0.0/16.

- IPv4 CIDR block:
  - large as <font color=blue> /16 </font> (2^16, or 65,536 addresses)
  - small as <font color=blue> /28 </font> (2^4, or 16 addresses)
- IPv6 CIDR block:
  - associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC and subnets, and assign IPv6 addresses from that block to the resources in your VPC.
  - IPv6 CIDR blocks have a different block size limit.

- The CIDR block of a subnet = the CIDR block for a VPC.
  - the VPC and the subnet are the same size (a single subnet in the VPC).
- the CIDR block of a subnet can be a subset < the CIDR block for the VPC.
  - This structure enables multiple subnets.
  - create more than one subnet in a VPC, the CIDR blocks of the subnets cannot overlap.
    - You cannot have duplicate IP addresses in the same VPC.


AWS reserves these IP addresses:
- 5 IP addresses are automatically reserved on every network range.
- `10.0.0.0` : Network address
- `10.0.0.1` : VPC local router (internal communications)
- `10.0.0.2` : Domain Name System (DNS) resolution
- `10.0.0.3` : Future use
- `10.0.0.255` : Network broadcast address

## Subnet sizes:

> Recommended: consider larger subnets over smaller ones, such as /24 and larger.

<font color=red> Choose larger range of IP ranges than smaller range </font>
- <font color=blue> simplifies workload placement </font>
  - place a workload among 10 small subnets is more complicated than place the same workload with one large subnet.
- <font color=blue> less likely to waste or run out of IP addresses </font>
  - subnet runs out of available IP addresses, can't add more IP addresses to that subnet.
  - For example, if you have 251 IP addresses in a subnet that's using only 25 of them, you can't share the unused 226 IP addresses with another subnet that's running out.
  - Consider where you will be five years down the road because this will save you a lot of time.
  - no necessary to limit Address Resolution Protocol, ARP, broadcast domains because this is solved by the VPC

## Subnet types:



To divide subnets.

- Subnets should be used to define internet accessibility
  - so might not good to have more than one public and one private subnet per Availability Zone.
  - ![subnets](https://i.imgur.com/1h4BAuS.png)

- resources in subnet:
  - <font color=red> all resources that require direct access internet </font> would go into the public subnet
    - (public-facing load balancers, NAT instances, bastion hosts, etc)

  - <font color=red> all other instances </font> would go into your private subnet
  - Exception: resources that require absolutely no access to the internet, either directly or indirectly.
      - These resources would go into a separate private subnet.


- use subnets to create layers of separation between "tiers" of resources
  - such as <font color=blue> put backend application instances and data resources in separate private subnets </font>
  - requires accurately predict hosts number needed in each subnet,
    - more likely run out of IP addresses more quickly,
    - or leave too many IP addresses unused when they could be used elsewhere.


- plan architecture
  - anticipate how many hosts the VPC need, how many hosts can be placed in private subnets.
  - anticipate how many public / private IP addresses the VPC needs,
  - reduce the risk of overcomplicating the infrastructure and waste / run out of IP addresses.

- use other resources to <font color=blue> create segregation between resources within a subnet </font>
  - segregation
    - Subnets can provide a very basic element of segregation between resources by <font color=red> NACL rules </font>
    - <font color=red> security groups </font> can provide even more fine-grained level of traffic control between resources

- <font color=red> Allocate substantially more IP address for private subnets than for public subnets </font>
  - ![Screen Shot 2020-06-21 at 19.53.57](https://i.imgur.com/vTZaT85.png)
  - <font color=blue> The majority of resources on AWS can be hosted in private subnets </font>
  - <font color=blue> use public subnets for controlled access </font> to and from the internet as necessary.
  - always need more private IP addresses than public IP addresses
    - because the more resources expose to the internet, the more vulnerable you become.
    - protect IP resources by placing them in a private subnet.




---

### public subnet
- <font color=red> routed to an internet gateway </font>
  - include <font color=blue> a routing table entry to an internet gateway </font>
  - internet gateway
    - The subnet route table has an attached Internet Gateway.
    - to support inbound or outbound access to the public Internet.
- “Auto-assign public IPv4 address” set to “Yes”.
  - every instance in VPC gets a public IP address automatically
  - can also request a public IP address to be assigned when create the instance by modifying the subnet’s auto-assign public IP address properties.


---

### private subnet
- <font color=red> does not have a route to an internet gateway </font>
  - do not have a routing table entry to an internet gateway
- <font color=red> Not directly accessible from the Public subnets </font>
  - If you private subnet requires internet access
    - for example: to download security patches for applications,
    - use a <font color=red> "jump box" </font>
    - to support the <font color=red> restricted, outbound-only </font> public internet access.
    - A “jump box”: <font color=blue> NAT, proxy, or bastion host </font>


- private
  - web-tier instances:
    - private subnets that are behind a load balancer placed in a public subnet.
    - If require web application instances to be attached to Elastic IP addresses directly, even though you can also attach an Elastic IP address to a load balancer. In those cases, web application instances would need to be in a public subnet.
  - Data store instances
  - Batch processing instances
  - Backend instances

---

### VPN-only subnet
- <font color=red> doesn’t have a route to the internet gateway </font>
- but has traffic routed to a <kbd>virtual private gateway</kbd> for a `VPN connection`
