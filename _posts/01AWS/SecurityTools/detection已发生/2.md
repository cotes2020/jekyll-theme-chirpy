# AWS GuardDuty

> identify malicious/unauthorized activity in `AWS account and workloads`


- intelligent threat detection service
- `continuously monitor and protect` the **AWS accounts and workloads**
  - analyzes billions of events across your AWS accounts
  - such as
    - information about AWS user and API activity in accounts from CloudTrail,
    - network traffic data from Amazon VPC Flow Logs,
    - name query patterns from DNS logs.
- `monitors environment` for malicious or unauthorized activiaty.
  - activities that can be associated with account compromise, instance compromise, and malicious reconnaissance
  - such as
  - `unusual API calls or potentially unauthorized deployments` that indicate a possible account compromise.
  - suspicious outbound communications to `known malicious IP addresses`
  - possible data theft that `use DNS queries as the transport mechanism`

- detects potentially compromised instances or reconnaissance by attackers.
  - identify malicious or unauthorized activities in AWS accounts


- delivers more accurate findings by **machine learning**
  - Use threat intelligence feeds to detect threats to the environment. such as lists of malicious IPs and domains.
  - can customize GuardDuty by adding your own threat lists and trusted IP lists.
- can enable GuardDuty through AWS Management Console
  - and have access to a more intelligent and cost-effective option for threat detection in the AWS Cloud
- Designed to actively protect the environment from threats.


Term
- Account:
  - standard AWS account that contains your AWS resources.
  - can sign in to AWS with your account, and enable GuardDuty.
  - can invite other accounts to enable GuardDuty, and these accounts can be associated with your AWS account in GuardDuty.
    - If your invitations are accepted,
    - your account is `master GuardDuty account`
    - the added accounts become your member accounts.
    - You can view and manage GuardDuty findings for member accounts on their behalf.
- data source:
  - the origin or location of a set of data.
  - To detect unauthorized and unexpected activity in AWS environment, GuardDuty analyzes and processes data from:
    - The origin or location of a set of data
    - CloudTrail event logs
    - VPC Flow Logs
    - And DNS logs
- finding
    - a potential security issue that is discovered by GuardDuty.
    - Findings are displayed in the GuardDuty console, and contain a detailed description of the security issue.
- **trusted IP list**
  - a list of whitelisted IP addresses for highly secure communication with AWS environment.
  - GuardDuty does not generate findings based on trusted IP lists.
- **threat list**
  - list of known malicious IP addresses.
  - GuardDuty generates findings based on threat lists.

## how Amazon GuardDuty works


![Screen Shot 2020-07-13 at 22.41.20](https://i.imgur.com/FE4RHAQ.png)

- connect all accounts, and enable GuardDuty within the AWS console.
  - can use the console to monitor your AWS accounts without additional security software or infrastructure to deploy or manage.
- GuardDuty looks at CloudTrail Events, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS Query Logs.
  - continuously analyzes those logs.
  - also automatically analyzes network and account activity at scale, and it provides broad, continuous monitoring of your AWS accounts and workloads.
- GuardDuty intelligently detects threats and malicious or authorized behavior by using managed rule sets, integrated threat intelligence, anomaly detection, and machine learning.
- After GuardDuty detects a threat,
  - it can use actionable alerts to review detailed findings in the console,
  - integrate into event management or workflow systems,
  - or trigger AWS Lambda for automated remediation or prevention.

## enable Amazon GuardDuty
￼
- AWS console > GuardDuty > enable GuardDuty.
- When enable GuardDuty, you give it permission to set up the appropriate service-linked roles and to analyze your logs.
- A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role
  - Is linked directly to an AWS service
  - Service-linked roles are predefined by the service, and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf.
  - The linked service also defines how you create, modify, and delete a service-linked role.
- When you enable GuardDuty, it immediately starts analyzing your VPC Flow Logs data.
  - It consumes VPC Flow Log events directly from the VPC Flow Logs feature through an independent and duplicative stream of flow logs.
  - This process does not affect any existing flow log configurations that might have.
- GuardDuty does not manage flow logs or make them accessible in your account.
  - To manage the access and retention of your flow logs, you must configure the VPC Flow Logs feature.
- There is no additional charge for Amazon GuardDuty access to flow logs.
  - However, enabling flow logs for retention or use in your account is subject to existing pricing
- After you enable GuardDuty, findings are displayed in the console.
  - The slide shows an example of the kinds of findings that are available in the console.
  - To access the findings: General Settings > Generate Sample Findings.
