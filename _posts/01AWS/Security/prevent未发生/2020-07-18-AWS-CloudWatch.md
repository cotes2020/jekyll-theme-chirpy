1. a <font color=red> monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the applications </font> run on AWS.
   - a repository for <font color=red> metric data </font>
   - a service that stores metrics
   - accessed via API, CLI, AWS SDKs, and the AWS Management Console.
   - CloudWatch can't monitor internal info, like memory usage, for EC2 instances.

2. CloudWatch integrates with AWS IAM
   - specify which user in your AWS account can perform CloudWatch.
   - create IAM policy, gives only certain users permission to use the `GetMetricStatistics` operation.
   - They could then use the operation to retrieve data about your cloud resources.

3. Permission:
   - can't use IAM to control access to CloudWatch data for specific resources.
   - For example,
     - you can't give a user access to CloudWatchdata for only a specific set of instances or a specific load balancer.
   - Permissions that are granted through IAM cover all of the cloud resources use with CloudWatch.
   - can't use IAM roles with the Amazon CloudWatch command line tools
   - The unified <font color=red> CloudWatch Agent </font>
     - runs in the cloud and on-premises, and on Linux and Windows instances and servers.
     - It also handles metrics and log files.
     - can deploy it using AWS Systems Manager, Run Command, SSM State Manager, or from the CLI.
     - doesn't provide the permissions to write to CloudWatch logs.
     - provides the connection need for on-premise to push data to CloudWatch and CloudWatch logs.
   - execution roles or permission roles:
     - permits a service to write logs to CloudWatch Logs

4. <font color=red> Monitors, Collects and tracks </font>
   - a distributes metrics gathering system, monitoring and observability service
     - built for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers (SRE), and IT managers.
   - statistics are recorded for a period of 15 months
   - monitors AWS resources and the applications run on AWS <font color=red> in real time </font>
     - collects and processes raw data from into readable, near-real-time metrics
     - collect and track metrics, measure for
       - you AWS resources and applications.

   - Create and use custom metrics
     - based on data generated by applications and services
     - along with any log files that applications generate.
     - Create custom dashboards for wasy viewing of metrics
   - Example:
     - Lambda functions, Kinesis streams, Amazon ECS tasks, Step Functions state machines,
     - SNS topics, SQS queues, and built-in targets…
     - CloudTrail, Route53, VPC flow logs
     - EC2
       - By default, EC2 provides <font color=blue> basic monitoring </font>, sends metric data to CloudWatch in 5-minute periods.
       - To send metric data for your instance to CloudWatch in 1-minute periods, enable <font color=blue> detailed monitoring </font> on the instance.
       - EC2 console displays a series of graphs based on the raw data from Amazon CloudWatch.
       - Depending on your needs, you might prefer to get data for your instances from Amazon CloudWatch instead of through the graphs in the console.
       - By default, Amazon CloudWatch does not provide RAM metrics for EC2 instances, though that is an option that you can configure if you want to CloudWatch to collect that data.
     - RDS:
       - number of simultaneous connection: xx for xx min
     - ELB:
       - number of healthy hosts: xx for xx min
     - DynamoDB tables.
     - RDS DB instances.
     - Custom metrics generated by applications and services.
     - Any log files generated by your applications.

6. gain <font color=red> system-wide visibility </font> about
   - resource use,
   - application performance,
   - operational health.
   - historical information
   - a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing.

8. produce metrics, and these are <font color=red> time-ordered </font> sets of data.

5. <font color=red> Turns metrics into statistics </font> to be used by CloudWatch alarms
   - Metrics can be configured with alarms that can take action.
     - collects metrics,
     - turns the metrics into statistics that can be used by CloudWatch alarms,
     - and displays them all in one place.
   - CloudWatch alarms are based on statistics.
     - Statistics are metric data that is aggregated over specified periods of time.
     - Aggregations are made using the namespace, metric name, dimensions, and the data point unit of measure, within the time period that you specify.
       - ![Screen Shot 2020-05-09 at 14.52.17](https://i.imgur.com/3vqVVFX.png)
       - Namespace
         - A namespace contains the CloudWatch metric that you want, for example, AWS/EC2.
       - Metric:
         - the variable you want to measure, for example, CPU Utilization.
       - Statistic:
         - can be an average, sum, minimum, maximum, sample count, a predefined percentile, or a custom percentile.
       - Period:
         - the evaluation period for the alarm.
         - When the alarm is evaluated, each period is aggregated into one data point.
       - Conditions:
         - specify the conditions for a static threshold, you specify whenever the metric is Greater, Greater or Equal, Lower or Equal, or Lowerthan the threshold value, and you also specify the threshold value.
       - Additional configuration information:
         - includes the number of data points within the evaluation period that must be breached to trigger the alarm, and how CloudWatch should treat missing data when it evaluates the alarm.
       - Actions:
         - choose to send a notification to an Amazon SNS topic,
         - or to perform an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling action or Amazon EC2 action.

7. Events
   - use CloudWatch Events to define rules
     - match incoming events/changes in AWS environment and route them to targets for processing.
     - operational changes as they occur
     - <font color=blue> if a rule is matched, can take corrective action as necessary </font>
   - Targets:
     - EC2 instances, Lambda functions, Kinesis streams, Amazon ECS tasks, Step Functions state machines, SNS topics, SQS queues, and built-in targets…
     - loudWatch Events already has access to AWS API events;
       - only need CloudTrail enabled when services aren't directly supported.
   - CloudWatch Events becomes aware of operational changes as they occur.
   - CloudWatch Events responds to these operational changes and takes corrective action as necessary, by
     - sending messages to respond to the environment,
     - activating functions,
     - making changes,
     - and capturing state information.
   - 2 options when creating a rule.
     - invoke a target <font color=blue> by its event patterns </font>
     - invoke a target <font color=blue> by a schedule </font>

9.  Alarms and action
    - key components of a CloudWatch alarm
      - 3 states:
        - insufficient:
          - no enough data to judge the state
          - alarms are often start in this state
        - alarm
          - the alarm threshold has been breached
          - such as: >90% CPU
        - ok
          - the threshold has not been breached
      - <font color=blue> thresholds </font>
        - create alarms based on:
          - static thresholds
          - anomaly detection.
          - metric math expression
      - <font color=blue> metrics </font>
        - measured data points over time.
      - <font color=blue> action </font>
        - action can produce an email or even work in conjunction with Auto Scaling groups.
      - <font color=blue> period </font> :
         - period is related to its threshold.
         - the length of time in which a threshold is surpassed before an alarm is generated.
    - can be <font color=blue> configured with alarms to take actions </font>
    - <font color=blue> actions can be used to trigger services </font>
      - a matched rule can take action on a target
      - Automatically react to changes in the AWS resources.
      - use the alarm to
        - automatically send notification to an Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic
        - triggers or perform an EC2 Auto Scaling in or out or EC2 action based on metrics
        - create alarm to monitor any Amazon CloudWatch metric in account
        - terminate, reboot, or recover an EC2 instance
    - <font color=blue> create alarms on </font>
      - the CPU utilization of an EC2 instance,
      - Elastic Load Balancing request latency,
      - Amazon DynamoDB table throughput,
      - Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue length,
      - the charges on your AWS bill.
      - <font color=blue> custom metrics </font> that specific to the custom applications or infrastructure.

10. no upfront commitment or minimum fee; pay for what you use.

## CloudWatch Logs


1. cloudWatch log group:
   - a container for log streams
   - export and set streams into other AWS services.
   - controls the retention period, metric filter, monitoring, and access control

2. log stream
   - a sequence of <font color=blue> log events with the same source </font>

3. log event
   - a timestamp and a raw message

4. metric filter
   - metric filter pattern matches text in all log events in all log streams of whichever log group it's created on, creating a metric

5. CloudWatch Logs
   - monitor and troubleshoot the systems and applications by existing system, application and custom log files.

   - take those logs and send them:
     - be streamed in real time to data-processing solutions, such as Amazon Kinesis Streams or AWS Lambda
     - to an Amazon S3—bucket for durability,
     - have administrators access them directly from the AWS Management Console.
   - With the CloudWatchLogs agent, you can quickly send both rotated and non-rotated log data off a host and into the log service. You can then access the raw log data when you need it.

   - real time application and system monitoring and long term log retention.
     - To store and monitor log data in highly durable storage.
     - keeps logs indefinitely by default.
     - can change the log retention setting, old log events are automatically deleted.

   - CloudTrail logs can be sent to CloudWatch Logs for real-time monitoring.
   - CloudWatch Logs metric filters
     - can evaluate CloudTrail logs for specific terms, phrases or values.

6. CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:
   - Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution custom metrics.
   - Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1 minute) are available for 15 days.
   - Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5 minute) are available for 63 days.
   - Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).

## example

review a cloud design pattern. Monitoring is necessary for system operation. A monitoring service is provided by the AWS Cloud.
- However, because the monitoring service in the AWS Cloud cannot monitor the internal workings of a virtual server—such as the operating system, middleware, applications, etc.
- need to have an independent monitoring system.
- For example,
- the virtual server is monitored by the AWS Cloud monitoring service,
- use your own system to monitor the operating system, middleware, applications, etc.
- The cloud monitoring service provides an API
  - enables you to use your monitoring system to perform centralized control, including of the cloud side
  - through this API, to obtain information from the cloud monitoring system.
- To implement the monitoring service, install monitoring software on the Amazon EC2 instance so that you can obtain monitoring information from the CloudWatch monitoring service.
  - Install monitoring software, such as Nagios, Zabbix, Munin…
  - Use a plug-in to obtain monitoring information by using the CloudWatch API, and to write that information to the monitoring software.
  - And use the plug-in to perform monitoring, including the information from AWS.
