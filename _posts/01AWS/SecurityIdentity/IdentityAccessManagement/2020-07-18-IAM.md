---


## <font color=red> IAM BEST PRACTICES </font>
- Lock away the AWS root user access keys.
  - <font color=red> no access key for the root account user </font>
- not use the root account for anything other than billing.
  - Power user access allows all permissions except the management of groups and users in IAM.

- Create <font color=red> individual IAM users </font>
- Use AWS defined `policies` to assign permissions whenever possible.
- <font color=red> Use groups to assign permissions </font> to IAM users.
- Grant least privilege.
- Use access levels to review IAM permissions.
- <font color=red> Use roles for applications </font> that run on AWS EC2 instances.
- Delegate by using roles instead of sharing credentials.
- Configure a strong password policy for users.
- <font color=red> Enable MFA for all users </font>
- Rotate credentials regularly.
- Remove unnecessary credentials.
- Use policy conditions for extra security.
- Monitor activity in your AWS account.
- Use <font color=red> Temporary Security Credentials (IAM Roles) </font> Instead of Long-Term Access Keys.
- Manage IAM User Access Keys Properly.

## basics

> 颗粒状的 Granular permissions

- a tool that centrally manages access to <font color=red> launching, configuring, managing, and terminating resources in the AWS account </font>

- grant different permissions to different people for different resources. 
  - **who, which, how**

- feature of the AWS account, no additional charge.



> IAM has the following features to control access:


- **provides Granular permissions** over access to resources, IAM can be used to manage:
  - provides <font color=red> 颗粒状的 Granular permissions </font>
    - grant different permissions to different people / resources.
  - Users. Groups. Access policies. Roles.
  - User credentials. User password policies.
  - for AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS software development kits (SDKs),
    - every call to an AWS service is an API call.
  - API keys for programmatic access (CLI).
    - including the ability to <font color=red> specify exactly which API calls the user is authorized to make to each service </font>



- **Shared access**
  - grant other people permission to administer and use resources in the AWS account
  - without having to share your password or access key.

- **Secure access** to AWS resources
  - Integrated with may AWS services.
  - manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
  - Secure access to AWS resources for applications that run on EC2.
  - create and manage AWS users and groups.
    - should use groups to assign permissions to IAM users
    - should <font color=red> avoid embedding access keys in application code </font>

- **Temporary security credentials**
  - IAM can assign temporary security credentials to provide users with temporary access to services/resources.
  - AWS access key ID, secret access key, and security token.

- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
  - Add two-factor authentication to the account and to individual users
  - extra security.
  - authentication device that generates random, six-digit, single-use authentication codes
  - authenticate using an MFA device in the following two ways:
    - `AWS Management Console`: user name, password and authentication code.
    - `AWS API`: restrictions are added to IAM policies and developers can request temporary security credentials and pass MFA parameters in their AWS STS API requests.
    - `AWS CLI`: obtaining temporary security credentials from STS (aws sts get-session-token).

- **Identity federation**
  - Identity Federation (including AD, Facebook etc.) can be configured
  - allow users who already have passwords elsewhere (corporate network) to get temporary access to the AWS account.
  - allowing secure access to resources in an AWS account `without creating an IAM user account`.
  - cannot use IAM to create local user accounts on any system.

- **Eventually consistent**


> IAM is <font color=red> not used for application-level authentication </font>

> IAM is <font color=red> universal (global)</font> and does not apply to regions.



- Identity information for assurance.


- PCI DSS compliance.


### to use AWS IAM

- AWS Management Console.
- AWS Command Line Tools.
- AWS SDKs.
  - recommend use AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to IAM.
- IAM HTTPS API.
- can also use IAM Query API to make direct calls to the IAM web service.
- sign-in URL:
  - `https://AWS_Account_ID.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/`
   - `https://console.aws.amazon.com/.`




## essential components

- `IAM user`:
  - a `person/application` that is defined in an AWS account, and that must make API calls to AWS products.
  - Each user must have a unique name (no spaces in name) within the AWS account,
  - and a set of security credentials that are different from the AWS account root user security credentials.
  - Each user is defined in one and only one AWS account.

- `IAM group`:
  - a collection of users.
  - use groups to `simplify specifying and managing permissions for multiple users`.

- `IAM policy`:
  - a document that defines permissions to determine what users can do in the AWS account.
  - A policy typically `grants access to specific resources to user, or explicitly deny access`.

- `IAM role`:
  - a tool for granting temporary access to specific AWS resources in an AWS account.
  - only selected users or applications.
  - Aws service can access other service.


Use `IAM Policies` to control access to the following:
- `AWS for Principals`
  - Control what the person making the request (theprincipal) is allowed to do.
- `IAM Identities`
  - Control which `IAM identities (groups, users, and roles)` can be accessed and how.
- `IAM Policies`
  - Control who can create, edit, and delete customer managed policies,
  - and who can attach and detach all managed policies.
- `AWS Resources`
  - Control who has access to resources
  - using an `identity-based policy` or a `resource-based policy`.
- `AWS Accounts`
  - Control whether a request is allowed only for members of a specific account.

## The IAM console
- provides information about when IAM users and roles last attempted to access AWS services. This information is called `service last accessed data`.
  - help you identify unnecessary permissions
  - to refine your IAM policies
  - to better adhere to the principle of “least privilege.”
  - granting the minimum permissions required to perform a specific task.
- You can find the data on the Access Advisor tab in the IAM console by examining the detail view for any IAM user, group, role, or managed policy.



---


## IAM policy

- By default
- <font color=red> the AWS account root user has full access </font>
- <font color=red> default AWS account users do not have any permissions to any resources/data in AWS account </font>
  - default AWS account has no access to any services:
  - must <font color=blue> explicitly grant permissions </font> to a user/group/role by `creating a policy`
  - attaching an IAM access policy to IAM user/group


- When there is a conflict, the most restrictive policy applies.
    - <font color=red>  allow vs deny: deny win </font>

- All permissions are denied by default.
  - The most restrictive policy is applied.
  - default <font color=blue> implicit deny </font> of an IAM identity can <font color=red> be overridden</font> with an <font color=blue> explicit allow </font> ???


- a document in `JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)` format
  - lists permissions that `allow / deny` access to resources in the AWS account.

- follow the principle of least privilege

- `the scope` of the service configurations `is global`.
  - The settings are not defined at an AWS Region level.  
  - settings apply across all AWS Regions.


- Resources are defined using the `ARN format`
  - the syntax for ARNs
  - `arn:partition:service:region:account-id:`


2 types of policy:
- **Identity-based policies**
- **Resource-based policies**
- **Service control policies (SCPs)**

---

### Inline Policies vs Managed Policies vs Custom Policies

**Managed policies**
- created and administered by AWS
  - prebuild, Standalone identity-based policies
  - cannot change
  - AWS managed policies have automatic updates.
  - has overhead, more rigid out of the two.
- for common use cased based on job function:
  - `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess`, `AWSCodeCOmmitPowerUser`, `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess`
- one policy can
  - assign to multiple users/groups/roles
  - in <font color=red> same/different AWS account </font>
- A Managed Policy `applies policies` to a user, group, or role (without exceptions).

**Customer managed policy**:
- managed by you
- Standalone policy user create
- more flexible but requires administration.
- policy can
  - assign to multiple users/groups/roles
  - in <font color=red> only your AWS account </font>



**Inline policies**
- managed by you
- embedded directly to a single user/group/role to which it aaplies.
  - when user/group/role been deleted, the policy also be deleted
- policy can
  - assign to one users/groups/roles
  - <font color=red> strict 1:1 relationship between entity and the policy </font>
  - in <font color=red> only your AWS account </font>
- usally Inline Policies are used <font color=blue> to create exceptions </font> to a user, group, or role.
  - when you want to be sure that the permissions is not been assigned to any other user.

> create in the user, add inline policy


---

### **Identity-based policies**
- A policy that is attached to an identity in IAM
  - less overhead to use a SCP for the entire AWS account.
  - permissions policies that attach to a principal/identity (user/role/group).
- <font color=red> control what actions that identity can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions </font>
- Identity-based policies categorized:
  - **Managed policies**
    - prebuild, Standalone identity-based policies
    - can attach to multiple users/groups/roles in AWS account
    - A Managed Policy `applies policies` to a user, group, or role (without exceptions).
      - **customer managed policy**:
        - more flexible but requires administration.
      - **AWS managed policy**
        - has overhead, more rigid out of the two.
        - AWS managed policies have automatic updates.
  - **Inline policies**
    - Policies embedded directly to a single user/group/role
    - Inline Policies are used to create exceptions to a user, group, or role.

---

### **Resource-based policies**
- `JSON policy documents that attach to a resource (S3 bucket...)`.
- `control what actions a specified principal can perform on that resource, and under what conditions`.
- **inline only**:
  - define the policy on the resource itself, instead of creating a separate policy document that you attach.
  - For example
    - create an S3 bucket policy (a type of resource-based policy) on an S3 bucket
    - -> the bucket
    - -> Permissions tab
    - -> Bucket Policy button
    - -> define the JSON-formatted policy document there.
- An `Amazon S3 access control list (ACL)` is another example of a resource-based policy

![HVBkIYM](https://i.imgur.com/FW1kVeh.png)

> identity-based policy.
> - An policy that grants access to the S3 bucket is attached to the MaryMajor user.

> resource-based policy.
> - The S3 bucket policy for the `photos bucket` specifies that the user MaryMajor is allowed to list and read the objects in the bucket.
> - An explicit deny statement will always take precedence over any allow statement.
> - could define a deny statement in a bucket policy to restrict access to specific  users, even if the users are granted access in a separate identity-based policy.

determines permissions
**explicit denial policy -> explicit allow policy -> deny**

---

### **Service control policies (SCPs)**

- one type of policy

- use <font color=red> to manage organization </font>
  - Attaching an SCP to an AWS Organizations entity (root, OU, or account)
  - defines a guardrail for what actions the principals can perform.

- enables <font color=red> permission controls </font>
  - can <font color=blue> limit account usage </font> to organizational units or linked accounts.
  - offer <font color=red> central control </font> over the maximum available permissions <font color=blue> for all accounts in organization </font>
  - ensure accounts stay in organization’s access control guidelines.

- available only in an organization that <font color=red> has all features enabled </font>
  - SCPs are not automatically enabled;
  - including consolidated billing
    - SCPs aren't available if organization has enabled only the consolidated billing feature

- <font color=red> restrict the root user of an Organization Unit account </font>
  - SCP is a way to restrict a root user on an account.
  - defines a safeguard for the actions that accounts in the organization root or OU can do.
  - Attaching an SCP to the organization root/unit (OU)
    - Log in to the master account and create the SCP
    - Select the <font color=blue> Organizational Unit </font>
    - <font color=blue> Enable the SCP </font> for the Organizational Unit
    - Attach the SCP to the member account within the Organizational Unit

- <font color=red> not a substitute for well-managed each account </font>
  - still need attach IAM policies to users/roles in organization's accounts
  - to actually grant permissions to them.

- similar to IAM permissions policies
  - almost the same syntax. JSON
  - but, SCP policies <font color=blue> never grants permissions. </font>
    - <font color=red> it the maximum permissions </font> for an organization or OU.

- <font color=red> No permissions are granted by an SCP </font>
  - it defines a guardrail, or sets limits, on the actions that the account's administrator can delegate to the IAM users/roles in the affected accounts.
    - The administrator must still attach `identity/resource-based policies` to IAM users/roles, or to the resources in accounts to actually grant permissions.
  - The <font color=blue> effective permissions </font>
    - the logical intersection between **what is allowed by the SCP** and **what is allowed by the IAM/Resource-based policies**
  - Important
    - SCPs don't affect users or roles in the management account.
    - affect only the member accounts in the organization.

- by default `FullAWSAccess`
  - a service control policy
  - allows users to access services/resources on an attached account.
  - allows access to all AWS services within an attached member account


---


## IAM root account


The root account has full administrative permissions and these cannot be restricted.

- Best practice for root accounts:
  - Don’t use the root user credentials.
  - Don’t share the root user credentials.
  - Create an IAM user and assign administrative permissions as required.
  - Enable MFA.

---

## IAM users

- maximum amount of IAM users per account: 5,000
- IAM users can be created to represent applications and these are known as “service accounts”.
- Each user account has a friendly name and an <font color=red> ARN </font> which uniquely identifies the user across AWS.
    - A unique ID is also created which is returned only when you create the user using the API, Tools for Windows PowerShell or the AWS CLI.

> You should create individual IAM accounts for users (best practice not to share accounts).


authenticate: how the user is permitted to use to access AWS resources.
- 2 types: 
  - programmatic access 
  - AWS Management Console access.
  - only or both


- **programmatic access**:
  - `access key ID` and a `secret access key`
    - cannot be used to login to the AWS console.
    - can only be used once and must be regenerated if lost.
  - to make an `AWS API call` by `AWS CLI/SDK/other development tool`.


- **AWS Management Console access**
  - browser login window.
    - 12-digit account ID / corresponding account alias.
    - `user name and password`
  - If multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled: an authentication code.
    - With MFA, users and systems must provide an `MFA token + the regular sign-in credentials`, before access AWS services and resources.
    - **for generating the MFA authentication token**:
      - `virtual MFA-compliant applications`(Google Authenticator / Authy 2-Factor Authentication...),
      - `U2F security key devices` (Yubikey)
      - `hardware MFA devices` (Gemalto)

## IAM group
Important characteristics of groups:
- A group can contain many users
- a user can belong to multiple groups.
- **Groups cannot be nested**.
  - A group can contain only users,
  - a group cannot contain other groups.
- There is `no default group` that automatically includes all users in the AWS account.
- group with all account users in it, you need to create the group and add each new user to it.
- A group is not an identity and `cannot be identified as a principal in an IAM policy`.

---

## IAM roles

![ilJwlvj](https://i.imgur.com/W0u4eW2.png)

- an identity in account that has specific permissions.
- is an AWS identity that can attach permissions policies
- but instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is `intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.`
- an IAM entity that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests.

- Roles can be assumed temporarily through the console or programmatically with the AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell or API.


- not using permanent credentials
  - `does not have standard long-term credentials` (password/access keys associated with it...)
  - assume a role, the role provides `temporary security credentials` for role session.
  - Temporary credentials are primarily used with IAM roles and automatically expire.
  - IAM users or AWS services can assume a role to obtain temporary security credentials that can be used to make AWS API calls.


- IAM roles are not associated with a specific user or group.
  - Instead, trusted entities assume roles, such as IAM users, applications, or AWS services such as EC2.
  - delegate permissions to resources for users and services
  - IAM users can temporarily assume a role to take on permissions for a specific task.


- assign limitation
  - A role can be assigned to a federated user who signs in using an external identity provider.
  - an IAM user in the same AWS account as the role or a user in a different AWS account.
  - but cannot apply multiple roles to a single instance.


- allowed to assume IAM Roles
  - `IAM Users`
    - When an IAM User is needing elevated permissions for a temporary task
  - `External accounts`
    - grant access to your account to third parties to perform an audit on your resources.
    - When a trusted remote account needs access to AWS resources
  - `AWS services/resources`
    - When an AWS service or resource needs access to other AWS service or resource
  - `Applications`
    - allow a mobile app to use AWS resources, but do not want to embed AWS keys within the app (difficult to rotate and can potentially extract).
    - When an external application needs access to an AWS resource like `DynamoDB`
  - **IAM Groups are not allowed to assume IAM Roles**.

- use roles to `delegate 托付 access to users/app/services` that do not normally have access to your AWS resources.
  - For example
  - grant users in the AWS account access to resources don't usually have, or grant users in one AWS account access to resources in another account.
  - grant AWS access to users who already have identities that are defined outside of AWS, such as in your corporate directory.


- two types of policies in an IAM Role
  - The `trust policy`
    - allows identities to assume roles
  - the `permission policy`
    - defines the permissions provided.
    - A permissions policy must also be attached to the user in the trusted account.

- Wildcards (`*`) cannot be specified as a principal.

- For all of these example use cases, roles are an essential component to implementing the cloud deployment.


- IAM roles with EC2 instances:
  - IAM roles can be used for granting applications running on EC2 instances permissions to AWS API requests using instance profiles.
  - Only one role can be assigned to an EC2 instance at a time.
  - A role can be assigned at the EC2 instance creation time or at any time afterwards.
  - When using the AWS CLI or API instance profiles must be created manually (it’s automatic and transparent through the console).
  - Applications retrieve temporary security credentials from the instance metadata.

## AWS Organizations


- With AWS Organizations, **Consolidated Billing** is always enabled.
  - All other features are either enabled / disabled as a group
  - cannot individually enable or disable a feature - it's all or nothing
