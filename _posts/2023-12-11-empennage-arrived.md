Holiday came early this year! The trucking company called me last week to schedule the delivery, and they unloaded the empennage crate this afternoon!

I've been telling Amy the empannage would arrive soon weeks ago, and she insisted she want to be there when opening the crate. So I waited until she came back from school in the afternoon to open the crate.

The wooden box is very well packaged. We opened it with some help from screwdrivers and a hammer. After taking some pictures, I went through the packing list to understand the inventory process.

I started to go through the parts and check them off from the inventory list, and quickly realized I need to better organize my workspace so the parts can be found some time in the future.

I went through a few parts on the packing sheet, but didn't get time to finish them all on the first day. Came back on the next day to finish everything.

All in all, I was missing 1 part (VOR anneta backplate) and 4 parts were sent with older revision. I sent an email to technical and they said it's fine, but needs to be installed with a different set of instruction. They sent the instruction in the email, so I will refer to their email when I get to that step.

On the not-so-good side, the dimple dies that came with the kit was not in a usable condition. They were rusted, sticking together and couldn't fit into my DRDT-2. So I ordered a new set of dies with Sling. Edward from Torrance was extremely responsive and hopefully he can help me source a new set of dies without waiting for the factory from South Afrca.




So some TODOs:

* Design a workspace organization system so parts are stored based on when I need them.
* Read through KAI a few steps ahead to confirm I have the tools needed.
* Buy hand seamer, drill bits, reamer.
