I was long curious about how does λ calculus become the foundation of formalizaing programming languages. It's strange that I haven't look up the answer until today: It's invented so early by Alonzo Church (whom I will write another post for) as an alternative mathematic foundation in 1930s and its relation with programming language was re-discoverred in 1960s.

From the "Lambda calculus and programming languages" section of wikipedia page:

> As pointed out by Peter Landin's 1965 paper "A Correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Church's Lambda-notation"

I found this name quite familiar since I read his paper "The mechanical evaluation of expressions" before, in which he introduced the first abstract machine for functional programming language, namely [SECD machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECD_machine). This paper also define the term [Closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)) which becomes a prevalent notion in computer programming nowadays.

Besides of that, his contributions also include:

- on ALGO definition
- [ISWIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISWIM) programming language
- [off-side rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule), known as "indentation-based" syntax nowadays, popularized by Miranda, Haskell, Python, etc.
- coin the term [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar)

He was much influenced by a study of McCarthy's LISP and taught [Tony Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare) ALGO with Peter Naur and Edsger W. Dijkstra. (Oh yes, definitely 4 more people to write).

I have just download his old, influential paper "The next 700 programming languages".
I am sure it will be an enjoyable read.
