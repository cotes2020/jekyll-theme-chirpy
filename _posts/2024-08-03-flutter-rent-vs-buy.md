[**Rent vs. Buy Calculator**]({% link pages/rent_vs_buy/index.html %})

Based off my previous post on [rent vs buy]({% link _posts/2024-03-09-buy-vs-rent.md %}), I have ported the code to [dart](https://github.com/jakee417/rent_vs_buy_flutter/blob/master/lib/rent_vs_buy.dart) and made a [web UI](https://github.com/jakee417/rent_vs_buy_flutter/blob/master/lib/main.dart) in [flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

The flutter UI supports:
- Interactive rent vs buy calculation
- Interactive charts
- Monthly cashflow breakdown export to CSV

Enjoy!
