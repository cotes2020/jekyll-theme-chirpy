### CVE-2002-1060 CacheOS unresolved hostname error cross-site scripting

Details

CacheOS is an operating system developed by Blue Coat Systems (formerly CacheFlow) for use with CacheFlow's Web caching devices.
CacheOS versions 4.1.06 and earlier running on Client Accelerators and Server Accelerators and CacheOS versions 2.1.02 and earlier running on Security Gateways are vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

- A remote attacker could create a `specially-crafted URL` containing embedded script in the host path, which would be executed in the victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting site
- once the link is clicked and an `unresolved hostname error message` is displayed.
- An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal a user's cookies.

Consequences:
Gain Access

Remedy
Upgrade to the latest version of CacheOS for your device, as listed in the BugTraq Mailing List posting dated Tue Sep 03 2002 - 00:37:13 CDT. See References.

### CVE-2002-1700 Adobe Macromedia ColdFusion default missing template page allows cross-site scripting

Cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) in the missing template handler in Macromedia ColdFusion MX allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary script as other users by injecting script into the HTTP request for the name of a template, which is not filtered in the resulting 404 error message.

Details

Macromedia ColdFusion MX running on Microsoft Windows 2000 and Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.
- The default Missing Template handler in ColdFusion MX does not properly filter file names for invalid characters when requesting a `'.cfm'` file.
- A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by embedding malicious JavaScript code as the file name, which would be executed on the system once the request is sent.

Consequences:
Gain Privileges

Remedy
Apply the latest patch for this vulnerability, as listed in Macromedia Security Bulletin MPSB02-03. See References.

**caused by improper filtering of user-supplied input**
- A remote attacker could create a `specially-crafted URL request` containing malicious HTML or Javascript
  - inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the query string
- cause an error message to be displayed and the script to be executed in the victim's Web browser within the security context of the host, once the link is clicked.

Consequences:
Gain Access

Remedy

Upgrade to the latest version of BBajie HTTP Web Server (0.95zxe1 or later), available from the Bajie Web site. See References.

### CVE-2005-2453 - Web Server Generic XSS
NetworkActiv Web Server Input Validation Flaw Permits Cross-Site Scripting Attacks

Impact:  Disclosure of authentication information, Disclosure of user information, Execution of arbitrary code via network, Modification of user information
Fix Available:  Yes  Vendor Confirmed:  Yes  Exploit Included:  Yes
Version(s): prior to 3.5.14; confirmed on 1.0, 2.0.0.6, 3.0.1.1, and 3.5.13
Description:   A vulnerability was reported in NetworkActiv Web Server. A remote user can conduct cross-site scripting attacks.

The web server does not properly filter HTML code from user-supplied input before displaying the input. A remote user can create a specially crafted URL that, when loaded by a target user, will cause arbitrary scripting code to be executed by the target user's browser. The code will originate from the site running the vulnerable software and will run in the security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.

A demonstration exploit URL is provided:

```
https://[target]?">[code]
```

The vendor was notified on August 4, 2005.

Impact:  A remote user can access the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site running the NetworkActiv Web Server software, access data recently submitted by the target user via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.

Solution:  The vendor has issued a fixed version (3.5.14), available at:

https://www.networkactiv.com/WebServer.html

Vendor URL:  www.networkactiv.com/WebServer.html (Links to External Site)
Cause:   Input validation error
Underlying OS:  Windows (Any)

### CVE-2006-1681 - Cherokee Webserver `handler_error.c` Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability

MODIFIED

This vulnerability has been modified since it was last analyzed by the NVD. It is awaiting reanalysis which may result in further changes to the information provided.

Current Description

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cherokee HTTPD 0.5 and earlier allows remote attackers to `inject arbitrary web script or HTML` via a malformed request that generates an HTTP 400 error, which is not properly handled when the error message is generated.

```
The problem resides, when introducing code HTML in the URL. Because previously, it was let now of a seemed failure, from version 0.4.8 filter the characters < > when an error 404 happens. But if cherokee does not understand the request (Error 400) gives back the string introduced by the user, without no modification, allowing that can be injected I code HTML, to the client.
```

Details

Cherokee Web Server is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input by the `cherokee/handler_error.c`.
- remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using the `build_hardcoded_response_page()` function to execute script in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site
- once the link is clicked and an error page is returned, allowing the attacker to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.

This issue can be exploited through a web client by:

```
https://www.example.com//..<script>alert("XSS_Discovered_by_Ruben_Garrote_Garcia_4_Mar_2006");<script>
https://localhost:80<script>alert("XSS_4_Mar_2006");</script>
https://localhost/..<script>alert("XSS_4_Mar_2006");<script>

```

Remedy

Upgrade to the latest version of Cherokee Webserver (0.5.1 or later)

### CVE-2012-3382 - Mono `ProcessRequest()` cross-site scripting

Details

Mono is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input by the `ProcessRequest()` function in mcs/class/System.Web/System.
- remote attacker use the `query string` to execute script in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.
- `Web/HttpForbiddenHandler.cs` in Mono 2.10.8 and earlier allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a file with a `crafted name and a forbidden extension`, which is not properly handled in an error message.

Remedy
Apply the patch for this vulnerability, available from the Mono GIT Repository. See References.
