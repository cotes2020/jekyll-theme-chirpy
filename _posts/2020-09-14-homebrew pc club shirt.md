I am now a proud owner of the shirt that was worn at the Home Brew Computer Club in the 80s. I first saw the shirt worn and designed by the personal computer pioneer Lee Felsenstein in the 1996 documentary “Triumph of the Nerds”. I searched for it on the net and luckily found only one item, which I immediately bought and framed in my office.
