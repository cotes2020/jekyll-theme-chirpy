I am a big fan of Steve Jobs, but it is essential to watch how a mix of ingenuity and arrogance when Steve was young can lead to failed implementations. After he was kicked off Apple in the 80s, Steve picked up several talents to create the NeXt computer, which he wanted to be the next big thing ever in the computer industry. He didn’t listen to his team, grew impatient, and was stubborn with certain decisions that proved costly later. Which is more important? Quality, cost, or time? The Next computer was ultimately not successful as a machine, but it was still an important milestone in the history of computers. It also empowered Steve Jobs to build beautiful products later on. Watch the PBS Entrepreneurs documentary about Steve Jobs with a critical eye. It was filmed before the NeCt pc was released to the public. Carefully watch the behavior of Steve and think of how you could have done things differently or the same. It is a learning opportunity for all of us.

Ten years later, Steve Jobs returned to Apple as a more experienced and still passionate (sold NeXT to Apple, owned Pixar that gave Toy Story to the world, and always loved the Apple he cofounded). Watch the 1997 video below and see the difference in the character and presentation between Gil Amelio, who was leading Apple, and Steve Jobs (shows up 7min later in the video). Compare the expressions between both. Notice the confidence and power from Steve and the lack of by Amelio. More importantly, notice the storytelling and how Steve embraced more the development community this time. Of course, Apple is not only Steve, and Steve is not only Apple. But the power of his message has set the stage of what Apple became a brand to the world. It is another learning opportunity for all of us techies.

'Apple “Think Different”  1997 Ad
“Think Different” Apple 1997 ad campaign that is so relevant for innovators and visionaries not just yesterday but every day today and for ever tomorrow

“Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes.

The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.”

About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They invent. They imagine. They heal. They explore. They create. They inspire. They push the human race forward.

Maybe they have to be crazy.

How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that’s never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?

We make tools for these kinds of people.

While some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.”

If you have not read the late Steve Jobs Commencement speech at Stanford in 2005 do check it below. “Stay hungry, stay foolish” he beautifully concludes.
