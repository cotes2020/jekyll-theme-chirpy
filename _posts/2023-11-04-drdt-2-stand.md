Since I built the DRDT-2 a few days ago, I have been wanting to build a stand for it. When DRDT sits on the stand, I want the top of the tool stay flush with my work bench.

I've recorded most of the work on my youtube vlog:

The stand was made entirely from 2x4s. I had to buy some wheels to put under the stand. To fix a mistake I made earlier (that the wheels I installed on
the workbench did not have movement locks) when building the EAA 1000 workbench, I bought a few extra wheels to replace the ones on EAA bench.

The stand was pretty easy to put together. But as a sidenote, because I did not have a blueprint to follow so I needed to learn to 3D model the 
stand's outline using a free app Shapr 3D. It was a lot of fun actually to play with :) I think I ended up spending more time on modeling than
cutting wood!
