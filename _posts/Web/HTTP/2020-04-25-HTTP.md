# HTTP - Method & Requests & Response

# 4.3 HTTP Method

## 4.3.1.  GET

![Screen Shot 2020-05-11 at 22.33.45](https://i.imgur.com/Ia7TTNV.png)

Syntax
- `GET /index.html`

The `GET` method
- **requests transfer of a current representation for the target resource**.
  - Requests using `GET` should **only retrieve data**.
  - Not secure, content will be in the URL.
  - the primary mechanism of information retrieval and the focus of performance optimizations.
    - when speak of retrieving some information via HTTP, it is generally making a `GET` request.
- It is tempting to think of
  - resource identifiers as remote file system pathnames
  - representations as **a copy of the contents of such files**.
  - In fact, that is how many resources are implemented.  However, there are no such limitations in practice.

- The HTTP interface for a resource is like a tree of content objects, a programmatic view on various database records, a gateway to other information systems.
- Even when the URI mapping mechanism is tied to a file system, an origin server might be configured to **execute the files with the request as input** and **send the output as the representation** rather than transfer the files directly.
- only the origin server needs to know
  - how each of its resource identifiers corresponds to an implementation
  - how each implementation manages to select
  - send a current representation of the target resource in a response to `GET`.

- A client can alter the semantics of `GET` to be a "range request",
  - requesting transfer of only some part(s) of the selected representation, by sending a Range header field in the request ([RFC7233]).
- A payload within a `GET` request message has no defined semantics;
  - sending a payload body on a `GET` request might cause some existing implementations to reject the request.
- The response to a `GET` request is cacheable;
  - a cache MAY use it to satisfy subsequent `GET` and `HEAD` requests unless otherwise indicated by the Cache-Control header field (Section 5.2 of [RFC7234]).

## 4.3.2.  HEAD

![Screen Shot 2020-05-11 at 22.39.27](https://i.imgur.com/c8yX1pS.png)

Syntax
- `HEAD /index.html`


| Method | Body                                                                                                              | header                                                                                                                                               |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | server MUST NOT send a message body in the response <br> the response terminates at the end of the header section |
| `HEAD` | `HEAD` response should not have a `body`. If so, it must be ignored.                                              | server SHOULD send the same header fields in response to a `HEAD` request as for `GET` request <br> except the payload header fields MAY be omitted. |


- A response to a `HEAD` method should not have a `body`. If so, it must be ignored.
  - Even so, entity headers describing the content of the body, like Content-Length may be included in the response.
  - They don't relate to the body of the `HEAD` response (should be empty), but to the body which a similar request using the `GET` method would have returned as a response.

- If the result of a `HEAD` request shows that a cached resource after a `GET` request is now outdated
  - the cache is invalidated, even if no `GET` request has been made.

- This method can be used for **obtaining metadata about the selected representation without transferring the representation data**
  - often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility, and recent modification.
  - 允许客户端在未获取实际资源的情况下，对资源的首部进行检查。
  - 在不获取资源的情况下了解资源的情况(比如，判断其类型);
  - 通过查看响应中的状态码，看看某个对象是否存在;
  - 通过查看首部，测试资源是否被修改了。

- A payload within a `HEAD` request message has no defined semantics;
  - sending a payload body on a `HEAD` request might cause some existing implementations to reject the request.


- The response to a `HEAD` request is cacheable;
  - a cache MAY use it to satisfy subsequent `HEAD` requests unless otherwise indicated by the Cache-Control header field (Section 5.2 of [RFC7234]).

- A `HEAD` response might also have an effect on previously cached `GET` responses.
- 服务器开发者必须确保返回的首部与 `GET` 请求所返回的首部完全相同。遵循 HTTP/1.1 规范，就必须实现 `HEAD` 方法。

## 4.3.3.  POST

￼￼![Screen Shot 2020-05-11 at 22.55.32](https://i.imgur.com/SpO6ed9.png)

Syntax
- `POST /test`

The `POST` method
- **requests that the target resource process the representation enclosed in the request** according to the resource's own specific semantics.
- sends data to the server.

- The type of the body of the request is indicated by the `Content-Type` header.

- `POST` is designed to allow a uniform method to cover the following functions:
  - Providing a block of data
    - such as the fields entered into an HTML form, to a data-handling process;
  - Posting a message
    - to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, blog, or similar group of articles;
  - Creating a new resource that has yet to be identified by the origin server
  - Appending data to a resource's existing representation(s).
  - Annotation of existing resources
  - Adding a new user through a signup modal;
  - Extending a database through an append operation.

The difference between `PUT` and `POST`
- `PUT` is idempotent: calling it once or several times successively has the same effect (no side effect),
- successive identical `POST` may have additional effects, like passing an order several times.

Responses to `POST`:
- origin server indicates response semantics by appropriate status code depending on the result of the `POST` request;
- almost all of the status codes might be received in a response to `POST`
  - (the exceptions being 206 (Partial Content), 304 (Not Modified), and 416 (Range Not Satisfiable)).

- If **resources has been created** on the origin server by processing a `POST` request,
  - the origin server SHOULD send a `201 (Created) response` containing
  - a `Location header` field that provides an identifier for the primary resource created
  - and a `representation` describes the status of the request while referring to the new resource(s).

- If the result of processing a `POST` would be equivalent to a representation of an existing resource
  - an origin server MAY redirect the user agent to that resource by sending a `303 (See Other) response` with the existing resource's identifier in the Location field.
  - This has the benefits of providing the user agent a resource identifier and transferring the representation via a method more amenable to shared caching, though at the cost of an extra request if the user agent does not already have the representation cached.

> Responses to `POST` requests are only cacheable when they include explicit freshness information.
> However, `POST` caching is not widely implemented.

- For cases where an origin server wishes the client to be able to **cache the result** of a `POST` in a way that can be reused by a later `GET`,
  - the origin server MAY send a `200 (OK) response` containing
  - the result
  - and a `Content-Location` header field that has the same value as the POST's effective request URI (Section 3.1.4.2).

A `POST` request is typically sent via an **HTML form** and results in a change on the server.
- the `content type` is selected by putting the adequate string in
  - the `enctype` attribute of the `<form>` element
  - or the `formenctype` attribute of the `<input>` or `<button>` elements:
- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`:
  - the keys and values are encoded in key-value tuples separated by `'&'`, with a `'='` between the key and the value.
  - Non-alphanumeric characters in both keys and values are percent encoded:
  - this is the reason why this type is not suitable to use with binary data (use multipart/form-data instead)
- `multipart/form-data`:
  - each value is sent as a block of data ("body part"), with a user agent-defined delimiter ("boundary") separating each part.
  - The keys are given in the `Content-Disposition` header of each part.
- `text/plain`

When the `POST` request is sent via method other than an HTML form — like **XMLHttpRequest** — the body can take any type.

Example

A simple form using the default `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type:

```
POST /test HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 27
field1=value1&field2=value2
```

A form using the `multipart/form-data` content type:

```
POST /test HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Content-Type: multipart/form-data;boundary="boundary"
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="field1"
value1
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="field2"; filename="example.txt"
value2
--boundary--
```

## 4.3.4.  PUT

![Screen Shot 2020-05-11 at 22.57.41](https://i.imgur.com/jm6mU3S.png)

Syntax
- `PUT /new.html HTTP/1.1`

URI = Universal Resource Identifier

URL = Universal Resource Locator

The `PUT` method
- requests the state of the target resource be **created or replaced with the state defined by the representation enclosed in the request message payload**.

Request

```
PUT /new.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 16
<p>New File</p>
```

Responses
- A successful response only implies that the user agent's intent was achieved at the time of its processing by the origin server.
  - A successful `PUT` of a given representation would suggest that a subsequent `GET` on that same target resource will result in an equivalent representation being sent in a `200 (OK) response`.
  - However, there is no guarantee that such a state change will be observable, since the target resource might be acted upon by other user agents in parallel, or might be subject to dynamic processing by the origin server, before any subsequent `GET` is received.

If the target resource
- **does not have** a current representation and the `PUT` successfully creates one
   - the origin server MUST inform the user agent by sending a `201 (Created) response`.
      ```
      HTTP/1.1 201 Created
      Content-Location: /new.html
      ```

- **does have a current representation** and that representation is successfully modified in accordance with the state of the enclosed representation
  - the origin server MUST send either a `200 (OK) / 204 (No Content) response` to indicate successful completion of the request.
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Content-Location: /existing.html
    ```

- origin server SHOULD **ignore unrecognized header fields received** in a `PUT` request
  - do not save them as part of the resource state

- origin server SHOULD verify that the `PUT` representation is **consistent with any 参数 constraints the server has for the target resource** that cannot or will not be changed by the `PUT`.
  - particularly important when the origin server uses internal configuration information related to the URI to set the values for representation metadata on `GET` responses.
  - When a `PUT` representation is inconsistent 不一致的 with the target resource
    - For example
      - if the target resource is configured to always have a Content-Type of "text/html"
      - and the representation being `PUT` has a Content-Type of "image/jpeg"
    - the origin server SHOULD
      - make them consistent, by transforming the representation or changing the resource configuration
      - transform the `PUT` representation to a format consistent with that of the resource before saving it as the new resource state;
      - reconfigure the target resource to reflect the new media type;
      - or respond with an appropriate error message.
      - containing sufficient information to explain why the representation is unsuitable.
      - The `409 (Conflict) or 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status codes` are suggested, with the latter being specific to constraints on Content-Type values.
      - reject the request with a `415 (Unsupported Media Type) response` indicating that the target resource is limited to "text/html", perhaps including a link to a different resource that would be a suitable target for the new representation.

- HTTP does not define exactly how a `PUT` method affects the state of an origin server beyond what can be expressed by the intent of the user agent request and the semantics of the origin server response.
- It does not define what a resource might be, in any sense of that word, beyond the interface provided via HTTP.
- It does not define how resource state is "stored", nor how such storage might change as a result of a change in resource state, nor how the origin server translates resource state into representations.
- Generally speaking, all implementation details behind the resource interface are intentionally hidden by the server.

An origin server MUST NOT send a validator header field, such as an ETag or Last-Modified field, in a successful response to `PUT`
- unless the request's representation data was saved without any transformation applied to the body (i.e., the resource's new representation data is identical to the representation data received in the `PUT` request) and the validator field value reflects the new representation.

This requirement allows a user agent to know when the representation body it has in memory remains current as a result of the PUT, thus not in need of being retrieved again from the origin server, and that the new validator(s) received in the response can be used for future conditional requests in order to prevent accidental overwrites.


POST和PUT请求最根本的区别是 Request-URI 的含义不同。
- POST请求里的URI指示一个能处理请求实体的资源：
  - 资源可能是一段程序，如jsp里的servlet），一个数据接收过程，一个网关（gateway，译注：网关和代理服务器的区别是：网关可以进行协议转换，而代理服务器不能，只是起代理的作用，比如缓存服务器其实就是一个代理服务器），或者一个单独接收注释的实体。
- PUT方法请求里有一个实体：
  - 用户代理知道URI意指什么，并且服务器不能把此请求应用于其他URI指定的资源。
  - 如果服务器期望请求被应用于一个不同的URI，那么它必须发送301（永久移动了）响应；
  - 用户代理可以自己决定是否重定向请求。

The fundamental difference between the `POST` and `PUT` methods:
- the different intent for the enclosed representation.
  - The target resource in a `POST` request is intended to handle the enclosed representation according to the resource's own semantics,
  - the enclosed representation in a `PUT` request is replacing the state of the target resource.
- the intent of `PUT` is idempotent and visible to intermediaries, even though the exact effect is only known by the origin server.
  - calling it once or several times successively has the same effect (no side effect)



Proper interpretation of a `PUT` request presumes that the user agent knows which target resource is desired.
- A service that selects a proper URI on behalf of the client, after receiving a state-changing request, SHOULD be implemented using the `POST` method rather than PUT.
- If the origin server will not make the requested `PUT` state change to the target resource and instead wishes to have it applied to a different resource, such as when the resource has been moved to a different URI
  - then the origin server MUST send an appropriate 3xx (Redirection) response;
  - the user agent make its own decision regarding whether or not to redirect the request.

A `PUT` request applied to the target resource can have side effects on other resources.
- For example
- an article have a URI for identifying "the current version" (a resource) that is separate from the URIs identifying each particular version (different resources that at one point shared the same state as the current version resource).
- A successful `PUT` request on "the current version" URI might therefore create a new version resource in addition to changing the state of the target resource, and might also cause links to be added between the related resources.

An origin server that allows `PUT` on a given target resource MUST send a 400 (Bad Request) response to a `PUT` request that contains a Content-Range header field, since the payload is likely to be partial content that has been mistakenly `PUT` as a full representation.
- Partial content updates are possible by targeting a separately identified resource with state that overlaps a portion of the larger resource, or by using a different method that has been specifically defined for partial updates (for example, the PATCH method defined in [RFC5789]).

PUT responses are not cacheable.
- If a successful `PUT` request passes through a cache that has one or more stored responses for the effective request URI, those stored responses will be invalidated.

## 4.3.5.  DELETE
￼
![Screen Shot 2020-05-11 at 23.36.00](https://i.imgur.com/GMMJhgV.png)

Syntax
- `DELETE /file.html HTTP/1.1`

![1460000013229199](https://i.imgur.com/hEBTzvg.png)

The `DELETE` method
- requests that the origin server **remove the association between the target resource and its current functionality**.
  - similar to the rm command in UNIX:
  - a deletion operation on the URI mapping of the origin server rather than an expectation that the previously associated information be deleted.

**If the target resource has one or more current representations**, they might or might not be destroyed by the origin server, and the associated storage might or might not be reclaimed,
- depending entirely on the nature of the resource and its implementation by the origin server (which are beyond the scope of this specification).

**other implementation aspects of a resource might need to be deactivated or archived** as a result of a `DELETE`, such as database or gateway connections.
- In general, it is assumed that the origin server will only allow `DELETE` on resources for which it has a prescribed mechanism for accomplishing the deletion.

Relatively few resources allow the `DELETE` method
- its primary use for remote authoring environments, where the user has some direction regarding its effect.
- For example,
  - a resource that was previously created using a `PUT` request,
  - or identified via the `Location header` field after a `201 (Created) response` to a `POST` request
  - might allow a corresponding `DELETE` request to undo those actions.
  - Similarly, custom user agent implementations that implement an authoring function, such as revision control clients using HTTP for remote operations, might use `DELETE` based on an assumption that the server's URI space has been crafted to correspond to a version repository.

Responses

If a `DELETE` method is successfully applied, the origin server SHOULD send
- a `202 (Accepted) status code` if the action will likely succeed but has not yet been enacted,
- a `204 (No Content) status code` if the action has been enacted and no further information is to be supplied,
- a `200 (OK) status code` if the action has been enacted and the response message includes a representation describing the status.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT

<html>
	<body>
		<h1>File deleted.</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```

A payload within a `DELETE` request message has no defined semantics; sending a payload body on a` DELET`E request might cause some existing implementations to reject the request.

Responses to the `DELETE` method are not cacheable.
- If a `DELETE` request passes through a cache that has one or more stored responses for the effective request URI, those stored responses will be invalidated.

## 4.3.6.  CONNECT

![Screen Shot 2020-05-12 at 00.08.41](https://i.imgur.com/sFqQGUi.png)

Syntax
- `CONNECT www.example.com:443 HTTP/1.1`

The `CONNECT` method
- a hop-by-hop method.
- requests that `the recipient establish a tunnel to the destination origin server` identified by the request-target, starts two-way communications with the requested resource.
  - if successful, thereafter restrict its behavior to blind forwarding of packets, in both directions, until the tunnel is closed.
- Tunnels are commonly used to create an end-to-end virtual connection, through one or more proxies, which can then be secured using TLS (Transport Layer Security).

For example, the `CONNECT` method can be used to access websites that use SSL (HTTPS).
- The client asks an HTTP Proxy server to tunnel the TCP connection to the desired destination.
- The server then proceeds to make the connection on behalf of the client.
- Once the connection has been established by the server, the Proxy server continues to proxy the TCP stream to and from the client.


`CONNECT` is intended only for use in requests to a proxy.
- An origin server that receives a `CONNECT` request for itself MAY respond with a `2xx (Successful) status code` to indicate that a connection is established.
- However, most origin servers do not implement `CONNECT`.

A client sending a `CONNECT` request MUST send the authority form of request-target;
- i.e., the request-target consists of only the host name and port number of the tunnel destination, separated by a colon.
- For example,

```
CONNECT server.example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com:80
```

**The recipient proxy can establish a tunnel either**
- by directly connecting to the request-target
- or, if configured to use another proxy, by forwarding the `CONNECT` request to the next inbound proxy.

Any `2xx (Successful) response` # the sender (and all inbound proxies) will switch to tunnel mode immediately after the blank line that concludes the successful response's header section; data received after that blank line is from the server identified by the request-target.

Any response other than a successful response # the tunnel has not yet been formed and that the connection remains governed by HTTP.

A tunnel is closed when a tunnel intermediary detects that either side has closed its connection:
- the intermediary MUST attempt to send any outstanding data that came from the closed side to the other side, close both connections, and then discard any remaining data left undelivered.

Proxy authentication might be used to establish the authority to create a tunnel.
- For example,

```
CONNECT server.example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com:80
Proxy-Authorization: basic aGVsbG86d29ybGQ=
```

significant risks in establishing a tunnel to arbitrary servers, well-known or reserved destination TCP port that is not for Web traffic.
- For example,
- a `CONNECT` to a request-target of "example.com:25" would suggest that the proxy connect to the reserved port for SMTP traffic;
- if allowed, that could trick the proxy into relaying spam email.
- Proxies that support `CONNECT` SHOULD restrict its use to a limited set of known ports or a configurable whitelist of safe request targets.

1. A server MUST NOT send any Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length header fields in a 2xx (Successful) response to `CONNECT`.
2. A client MUST ignore any Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header fields received in a successful response to `CONNECT`.

A payload within a `CONNECT` request message has no defined semantics;
- sending a payload body on a `CONNECT` request might cause some existing implementations to reject the request.

`CONNECT` Responses are not cacheable.

## 4.3.7.  OPTIONS

![Screen Shot 2020-05-12 at 00.30.38](https://i.imgur.com/WGG6NuB.png)

Syntax

```
OPTIONS /index.html HTTP/1.1
OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
```

The `OPTIONS` method
- requests information about the **communication options available for the target resource**, at either the origin server or an intervening intermediary.
  - allows a client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action.

An `OPTIONS` request with an asterisk (`"*"`)
- the request-target applies to the server in general rather than to a specific resource.
- Since a server's communication options typically depend on the resource, the `"*"` request is only useful as a "ping" or "no-op" type of method;
- it does nothing beyond allowing the client to test the capabilities of the server.
- For example
  - this can be used to test a proxy for HTTP/1.1 conformance (or lack thereof).

If the `OPTIONS` request-target is not an asterisk
- the `OPTIONS` request applies to the options that are available when communicating with the target resource.


A server generating a successful response to `OPTIONS` SHOULD **send any header fields** that indicate `optional features implemented by the server and applicable to the target resource` (e.g., Allow), including potential extensions not defined by this specification.
- The response payload, if any
  - might also describe the communication options in a machine or human-readable representation.
- A standard format for such a representation is not defined by this specification, but might be defined by future extensions to HTTP.
- A server MUST generate a `Content-Length field` with a value of "0" if no payload body is sent in the response.

A client MAY send a `Max-Forwards header` field in an `OPTIONS` request to target a specific recipient in the request chain.
A proxy MUST NOT generate a Max-Forwards header field while forwarding a request unless that request was received with a Max-Forwards field.

A client that generates an `OPTIONS` request containing a payload body MUST send a valid Content-Type header field describing the representation media type.
- Although this specification does not define any use for such a payload, future extensions to HTTP might use the `OPTIONS` body to make more detailed queries about the target resource.

Responses to the `OPTIONS` method are not cacheable.

### Identifying allowed request methods
find out which request methods a server supports

1. use `curl` and issue an `OPTIONS` request:

```
curl -X OPTIONS https://example.org -i

// The response then contains an Allow header with the allowed methods:

HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Allow: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST
Cache-Control: max-age=604800
Date: Thu, 13 Oct 2016 11:45:00 GMT
Expires: Thu, 20 Oct 2016 11:45:00 GMT
Server: EOS (lax004/2813)
x-ec-custom-error: 1
```

2. Preflighted requests in CORS
- In CORS, a preflight request with the `OPTIONS` method is sent, server can respond whether it is acceptable to send the request with these parameters.
- The `Access-Control-Request-Method` header
  - notifies the server as part of a preflight request that when the actual request is sent,
  - it will be sent with a `POST` request method.
- The `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header
  - notifies the server that when the actual request is sent, it will be sent with a `X-PINGOTHER and Content-Type` custom headers.
  - The server now has an opportunity to determine whether it wishes to accept a request under these circumstances.

```
OPTIONS /resources/post-here/ HTTP/1.1
Host: bar.other
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
Connection: keep-alive
Origin: https://foo.example
Access-Control-Request-Method: POST
Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-PINGOTHER, Content-Type
```

- The server responds with `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` and says that `POST, GET, and OPTIONS` are viable methods to query the resource in question.
- This header is similar to the Allow response header, but used strictly within the context of CORS.

```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Date: Mon, 01 Dec 2008 01:15:39 GMT
Server: Apache/2.0.61 (Unix)
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.example
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-PINGOTHER, Content-Type
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
Vary: Accept-Encoding, Origin
Keep-Alive: timeout=2, max=100
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

## 4.3.8.  TRACE

![Screen Shot 2020-05-12 at 01.06.06](https://i.imgur.com/Ptp8Hxx.png)

Syntax
- `TRACE /index.html`

The `TRACE` method
- **requests a remote, application-level loop-back of the request message**.
  - performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource
  - useful debugging mechanism.
- The final recipient of the request SHOULD reflect the message received,
  - excluding some fields described below, back to the client as the message body of a `200 (OK) response` with a Content-Type of "message/http".
- The final recipient is either the origin server or the first server to receive a `Max-Forwards` value of zero (0) in the request.

`TRACE` request,
- A client MUST NOT generate header fields containing sensitive data that might be disclosed by the response.
  - do not send stored user credentials or cookies in a `TRACE` request.
- The final recipient of the request exclude any request header fields that are likely to contain sensitive data when that recipient generates the response body.

`TRACE` allows the client to see what is being received at the other end of the request chain and use that data for testing or diagnostic information.
- The value of the `Via` header field is of particular interest, since it acts as a trace of the request chain.
- Use of the Max-Forwards header field allows the client to limit the length of the request chain, which is useful for testing a chain of proxies forwarding messages in an infinite loop.

A client MUST NOT send a message body in a `TRACE` request.

Responses to the `TRACE` method are not cacheable.

---

## PATCH

The HTTP `PATCH` request method 
- applies **partial modifications** to a resource.
- PATCH is somewhat analogous to the "update" concept found in CRUD (in general, HTTP is different than CRUD, and the two should not be confused).

A `PATCH` request is considered a set of instructions on how to modify a resource.
- Contrast this with `PUT`; which is a **complete representation** of a resource.

A `PATCH` is not necessarily idempotent, although it can be.
- Contrast with `PUT`, always idempotent.
- For example
- if an auto-incrementing counter field is an integral part of the resource, then a `PUT` will naturally overwrite it (since it overwrites everything), but not necessarily so for `PATCH`.

`PATCH `(like `PUT`) may have side-effects on other resources.
- To find out whether a server supports `PATCH`
- a server can advertise its support by adding it to the list in the `Allow or Access-Control-Allow-Methods` (for CORS) response headers.
- Another (implicit) indication that `PATCH` is allowed, is the presence of the `Accept-Patch` header, which specifies the patch document formats accepted by the server.

Syntax

```
PATCH /file.txt HTTP/1.1
Example
Request
PATCH /file.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Content-Type: application/example
If-Match: "e0023aa4e"
Content-Length: 100
[description of changes]
```

Response
- A successful response is indicated by any `2xx status code`.
- `204 response code` is used, because the response does not carry a payload body.
- A `200 response` could have contained a payload body.

```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Location: /file.txt
ETag: "e0023aa4f"
```

# HTTP - Requests

An HTTP client sends an HTTP request to a server in the form of a request message which includes following format:

```
A Request-line

Zero or more header (General|Request|Entity) fields followed by CRLF

An empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF)
indicating the end of the header fields

Optionally a message-body
```

---

## Request-Line

The Request-Line begins with a `method token`, followed by the `Request-URI` and the `protocol version`, and ending with `CRLF`. The elements are separated by space `SP` characters.

Request-Line = `Method` SP `Request-URI` SP `HTTP-Version` `CRLF`


## Request-URI

The Request-URI is a `Uniform Resource Identifier` and identifies the resource upon which to apply the request.

`Request-URI = "*" | absoluteURI | abs_path | authority`

```bash
# 1. The asterisk *
# used when an HTTP request does not apply to a particular resource, but to the server itself
# only allowed when the method used does not necessarily apply to a resource.
OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1

# 2. The absoluteURI
# used when an HTTP request is being made to a proxy.
# The proxy is requested to forward the request or service from a valid cache, and return the response.
GET https://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1

# 3. The most common form of Request-URI
# to identify a resource on an origin server or gateway.
# For example, a client wishing to retrieve a resource directly from the origin server would create a TCP connection to port 80 of the host "www.w3.org" and send the following lines:
GET /pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.w3.org
# Note that the absolute path cannot be empty; if none is present in the original URI, it MUST be given as "/" (the server root).
```

## General-header, Entity-header and Request header

- `POST` /cgi-bin/process.cgi `HTTP/1.1`
- `User-Agent`: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
- `Host`: www.tutorialspoint.com
- `Content-Type`: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
- `Content-Length`: 12345
- `Accept-Language`: en-us
- `Accept-Encoding`: gzip, deflate
- `Connection`: Keep-Alive
- licenseID=string&content=string&/paramsXML=string


### Request Header Fields

The request-header fields
- allow the client to pass additional information about the request, and about the client itself, to the server.
- These fields act as request modifiers.

```bash
# to fetch hello.htm page from the web server running on tutorialspoint.com
# not sending any request data to the server because we are fetching a plain HTML page from the server.
GET /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
# Connection is a general-header, and the rest of the headers are request headers.


POST /cgi-bin/process.cgi HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
# the passed data is a simple web form data
Content-Length: 12345
# the actual length of the data put in the message body
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
licenseID=string&content=string&/paramsXML=string
```


---

# HTTP - Responses

After receiving and interpreting a request message, a server responds with an HTTP response message:

```
A Status-line

Zero or more header (General|Response|Entity) fields followed by CRLF

An empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF) indicating the end of the header fields

Optionally a message-body
```

---

## Message Status-Line

A Status-Line consists of the protocol version followed by a numeric status code and its associated textual phrase.

Status-Line = `HTTP-Version` SP `Status-Code` SP `Reason-Phrase` CRLF```

---

### HTTP Version

`HTTP-Version = HTTP/1.1````

---

### Status Code

3-digit integer
- first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response
- the last two digits do not have any categorization role.

```bash
1xx: Informational
# It means the request was received and the process is continuing.

2xx: Success
# It means the action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

3xx: Redirection
# It means further action must be taken in order to complete the request.

4xx: Client Error
# It means the request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be fulfilled.

5xx: Server Error
# It means the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.
```

---


# HTTP - Header Fields

HTTP header fields provide required information about the request or response, or about the object sent in the message body. There are four types of HTTP message headers:

- `General-header`: These header fields have general applicability for both request and response messages.
- `Client Request-header`: These header fields have applicability only for request messages.
- `Server Response-header`: These header fields have applicability only for response messages.
- `Entity-header`: These header fields define meta information about the entity-body or, if no body is present, about the resource identified by the request.


## General Headers

### Cache-Control 怎么留留多久
- `Cache-Control : cache-request-directive | cache-response-directive`
- An HTTP client or server use it
- specify directives that MUST be obeyed by all the caching system.
- specify parameters for the cache


`cache request directives` that can be **used by the client in its HTTP request**:

```bash
1	no-cache
# A cache must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin server.

2	no-store
# The cache should not store anything about the client request or server response.

3	max-age = seconds
# the client is willing to accept a response
# whose age is not greater than the specified time in seconds.

4	max-stale [ = seconds ]
# the client is willing to accept a response that has exceeded its expiration time.
# If seconds are given, it must not be expired by more than that time.

5	min-fresh = seconds
# the client is willing to accept a response
# whose freshness lifetime is not less than its current age plus the specified time in seconds.

6	no-transform
# Does not convert the entity-body.

7	only-if-cached
# Does not retrieve new data.
# The cache can send a document only if it is in the cache, and should not contact the origin-server to see if a newer copy exists.
```

`cache response directives` that can **be used by the server in its HTTP response**:

```bash
1	public
# the response may be cached by any cache.

2	private
# all or part of the response message is intended for a single user
# must not be cached by a shared cache.

3	no-cache
# A cache must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful re-validation with the origin server.

4	no-store
# The cache should not store anything about the client request or server response.

5	no-transform
# Does not convert the entity-body.

6	must-revalidate
# The cache must verify the status of the stale documents before using it and expired ones should not be used.

7	proxy-revalidate
# The proxy-revalidate directive has the same meaning as the must- revalidate directive, except that it does not apply to non-shared user agent caches.

8	max-age = seconds
# the client is willing to accept a response
# whose age is not greater than the specified time in seconds.

9	s-maxage = seconds
# The maximum age specified by this directive overrides the maximum age specified by either the max-age directive or the Expires header.
# The s-maxage directive is always ignored by a private cache.
```

---

### Connection 告诉server希望close还是keep-alive
- allows the sender to `specify options` that are desired for that particular connection and `must not be communicated by proxies` over further connections.

`Connection : "Connection"`
- HTTP/1.1 defines the "close" connection option for the sender
- to signal that the connection will be closed after completion of the response.

```bash
Connection: close
# By default, HTTP 1.1 uses persistent connections, where the connection does not automatically close after a transaction. HTTP 1.0, on the other hand, does not have persistent connections by default.

Connection: keep-alive
# If a 1.0 client wishes to use persistent connections, it uses the keep-alive parameter
```

---

### Date

All HTTP date/time stamps MUST be represented in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), without exception.

HTTP applications are allowed to use any of the following three representations of date/time stamps:

```bash
# Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
Here the first format is the most preferred one.
Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI Cs asctime() format
```

---

### Pragma

to include implementation specific directives that might apply to any recipient along the request/response chain.

```bash
Pragma: no-cache
# The only directive defined in HTTP/1.0 is the no-cache directive and is maintained in HTTP 1.1 for backward compatibility.
# No new Pragma directives will be defined in the future.
```

---

### Trailer

indicates that `the given set of header fields` is present in `the trailer of a message` encoded with chunked transfer-coding.

```bash
Trailer : field-name
# Message header fields listed in the Trailer header field must not include the following header fields:

Transfer-Encoding
Content-Length
Trailer
```

---

### Transfer-Encoding

indicates `what type of transformation has been applied to the message body`
- in order to safely transfer it between the sender and the recipient.
- This is not the same as content-encoding because transfer-encodings are a property of the message, not of the entity-body.
- All transfer-coding values are case-insensitive.

```bash
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```

---

### Upgrade

allows the client to specify what additional communication protocols it supports and would like to use if the server finds it appropriate to switch protocols.
- provide a simple mechanism for transition from HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol.

```bash
Upgrade: HTTP/2.0, HTTPS/1.3, IRC/6.9, RTA/x11
```

---

### Via 中途proxy路径
- to provide a simple mechanism for transition from HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol.
- must be used by gateways and proxies to indicate the intermediate protocols and recipients.
- For example:
  - a request message sent from an **HTTP/1.0** `user agent` to an `internal proxy code-named "fred"`
  - `internal proxy code-named "fred"` uses **HTTP/1.1** to forward the request to a `public proxy at nowhere.com`
  - `public proxy at nowhere.com` to forward it to the `origin server at www.ics.uci.edu`.
  - request completes
- The request received by www.ics.uci.edu would then have the following Via header field:

```bash
Via: 1.0 fred, 1.1 nowhere.com (Apache/1.1)
```

---

### Warning

- carry `additional information about the status or transformation` of a message which `might not be reflected in the message`.
- A response may carry more than one Warning header.

```bash
Warning : warn-code SP warn-agent SP warn-text SP warn-date
```

---

## Client Request Headers

---

### Accept 什么样的文件 text/plain/html/x-dvi/x-c

- specify `certain media types` which are acceptable for the response.

```bash
Accept: type/subtype [q=qvalue]
# Multiple media types can be listed separated by commas
# the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for accept types on a scale of 0 to 1.

Accept: text/plain; q=0.5, text/html, text/x-dvi; q=0.8, text/x-c
# This would be interpreted as text/html and text/x-c are the preferred media types
# but if they do not exist, then send the text/x-dvi entity
# if that does not exist, send the text/plain entity.
```

---

### Accept-Charset 接受的字符

- indicate what `character sets` are acceptable for the response.

```bash
Accept-Charset: character_set [q=qvalue]
# Multiple character sets can be listed separated by commas and the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for nonpreferred character sets on a scale of 0 to 1. Following is an example:

Accept-Charset: iso-8859-5, unicode-1-1; q=0.8
# The special value "*", if present in the Accept-Charset field, matches every character set and if no Accept-Charset header is present, the default is that any character set is acceptable.
```

---

### Accept-Encoding

- similar to Accept, but restricts the `content-codings that are acceptable` in the response.

```bash
Accept-Encoding: encoding types

# Examples:
Accept-Encoding: compress, gzip
Accept-Encoding:
Accept-Encoding: *
Accept-Encoding: compress;q=0.5, gzip;q=1.0
Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0, identity;q=0.5, *;q=0
```

---

### Accept-Language

- similar to Accept, but restricts the set of natural languages that are preferred as a response to the request.

```bash
Accept-Language: language [q=qvalue]
# Multiple languages can be listed separated by commas and the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for non preferred languages on a scale of 0 to 1. Following is an example:

Accept-Language: da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7
```

---

### Authorization 后接encode的验证信息

- consists of credentials containing the `authentication information of the user agent` for the `realm` of the resource being requested.

```bash
Authorization : credentials
# The HTTP/1.0 specification defines the BASIC authorization scheme, where the authorization parameter is the string of username:password encoded in base 64.

Authorization: BASIC Z3Vlc3Q6Z3Vlc3QxMjM=
# The value decodes into is guest:guest123 where guest is user ID and guest123 is the password.
```

---

### Cookie

- contains a name/value pair of information stored for that URL.

```bash
Cookie: name=value
Multiple cookies can be specified separated by semicolons as follows:

Cookie: name1=value1;name2=value2;name3=value3
```

---

### Expect 用户要求的server行动

- indicate that a `particular set of server behaviors is required by the client`.

```bash
Expect : 100-continue | expectation-extension
# If a server receives a request containing an Expect field that includes an expectation-extension that it does not support,
# it must respond with a 417 (Expectation Failed) status.
```

---

### From

- contains an Internet e-mail address for the human user who controls the requesting user agent.

```bash
From: webmaster@w3.org
# This header field may be used for logging purposes and as a means for identifying the source of invalid or unwanted requests.
```

---

### Host
- to specify the Internet host and the port number of the resource being requested.

```bash
Host : "Host" ":" host [ ":" port ] ;
# A host without any trailing port information implies the default port, which is 80.

# request on the origin server for https://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/ would be:
GET /pub/WWW/ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.w3.org
```

---

### If-Match
- used with a method to make it conditional.
- This header `requests the server to perform the requested method`
- only if the `given value in this tag` matches the `given entity tags represented by ETag`.
- If none of the entity tags match, or if "*" is given and no current entity exists
- the server must not perform the requested method, and must return a `412 (Precondition Failed) response`.

```bash
If-Match : entity-tag
# An asterisk (*) matches any entity, and the transaction continues only if the entity exists.

If-Match: "xyzzy"
If-Match: "xyzzy", "r2d2xxxx", "c3piozzzz"
If-Match: *
```

---

### If-Modified-Since
- used with a method to make it conditional.
- If the requested URL `has not been modified since the time` specified in this field
  - an entity will not be returned from the server;
- instead, a `304 (not modified) response` will be returned without any message-body.
- If none of the entity tags match, or if "*" is given and no current entity exists, the server must not perform the requested method, and must return a `412 (Precondition Failed) response`.

```bash
If-Modified-Since : HTTP-date
# An example of the field is:

If-Modified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT
```

---

### If-None-Match
- used with a method to make it conditional.
- This header requests the server to perform the requested method only if none of the `given value in this tag` matches the `given entity tags represented by ETag`.

```bash
If-None-Match : entity-tag
# An asterisk (*) matches any entity, and the transaction continues only if the entity does not exist.

If-None-Match: "xyzzy"
If-None-Match: "xyzzy", "r2d2xxxx", "c3piozzzz"
If-None-Match: *
```

---

### If-Range 时间 本日部分更新/全新一日更新
- can be used with a conditional `GET` to
  - request `only the portion of the entity that is missing`, if it has not been changed,
  - `the entire entity` if it has been changed.

```bash
If-Range : entity-tag | HTTP-date
# Either an entity tag or a date can be used to identify the partial entity already received. For example:

If-Range: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT
# Here if the document has not been modified since the given date, the server returns the byte range given by the Range header, otherwise it returns all of the new document.
```

---

### If-Unmodified-Since 如果在此时间前无修改的话
- used with a method to make it conditional.
- If the requested resource has not been modified since the time, the server should perform the requested operation
  - as if the If-Unmodified-Since header were not present.

```bash
If-Unmodified-Since : HTTP-date
# If the requested resource has not been modified since the time specified in this field, the server should perform the requested operation as if the If-Unmodified-Since header were not present.

If-Unmodified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT
If the request results in anything other than a 2xx or 412 status, the If-Unmodified-Since header should be ignored.
```

---

### Max-Forwards 最大跳跃数
- provides a mechanism with the `TRACE` and `OPTIONS` methods
- limit the `number of proxies or gateways that can forward` the request to the next inbound server.
- This is useful for debugging with the `TRACE` method, avoiding infinite loops.

```bash
Max-Forwards : 5
# The Max-Forwards header field may be ignored for all other methods defined in the HTTP specification.
  # - The Max-Forwards value is a decimal integer
  # - indicating `the remaining number of times` this request message may be forwarded.
```

---

### Proxy-Authorization 认证信息
- `allows the client to identify itself/user to a proxy which requires authentication`.

```bash
Proxy-Authorization : credentials
# The Proxy-Authorization field value consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user agent for the proxy and/or realm of the resource being requested.
```

---

### Range 取信息范围byte
- specifies the `partial range(s) of the content requested from the document`.

```bash
Range: bytes-unit= [first-byte-pos] - [last-byte-pos]
# The first-byte-pos: the first byte in a range.
# The last-byte-pos: the byte-offset of the last byte in the range;
# the byte positions specified are inclusive.
# can specify a byte-unit as bytes.
# Byte offsets start at zero.

# - The first 500 bytes
Range: bytes=0-499
# - The second 500 bytes
Range: bytes=500-999

# - The final 500 bytes
Range: bytes=-500

# - The first and last bytes only
Range: bytes=0-0,-1
# Multiple ranges can be listed, separated by commas.

# If the first digit in the comma-separated byte range(s) is missing, the range is assumed to count from the end of the document.
# If the second digit is missing, the range is byte n to the end of the document.
```

---

### Referer 来自何网址的请求
- allows the client to specify the URI of the resource `from which the URL has been requested`.

```bash
Referer : absoluteURI | relativeURI

Referer: https://www.tutorialspoint.org/ http/index.htm
# If the field value is a relative URI, it should be interpreted relative to the Request-URI.
```

---

### TE
- indicates `what extension transfer-coding it is willing to accept` in the response and whether or not it is willing to accept `trailer` fields in a chunked transfer-coding.

```bash
TE   : t-codings
# The presence of the keyword "trailers" indicates that the client is willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked transfer-coding and it is specified either of the ways

TE: trailers, deflate;q=0.5
TE: deflate
TE:
# If the TE field-value is empty or if no TE field is present, then only transfer-coding is chunked.
# A message with no transfer-coding is always acceptable.
```

---

### User-Agent 阅览器信息
- contains `information about the user agent` originating the request.

```bash
# The general syntax:
User-Agent : product | comment

User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
```

---

### Accept-Ranges
- allows the server to indicate its acceptance of range requests for a resource.

```bash
# The general syntax is:
Accept-Ranges  : range-unit | none

# For example a server that accepts byte-range requests may send:
Accept-Ranges: bytes

# Servers that do not accept any kind of range request for a resource may send:
Accept-Ranges: none
# This will advise the client not to attempt a range request.
```

---

### Age 有cache就需要这个
- conveys the sender's estimate of the amount of time since the response (or its revalidation) was generated at the origin server.
- An HTTP/1.1 server that `includes a cache` **must include an Age header field** in every response generated from its own cache.

```bash
# The general syntax is:
Age : delta-seconds
# Age values are non-negative decimal integers, representing time in seconds.

Age: 1030
```

---

### ETag
- provides the current value of the entity tag for the requested variant.

```bash
# The general syntax is:
ETag :  entity-tag

ETag: "xyzzy"
ETag: W/"xyzzy"
ETag: ""
```

---

### Location redirect用户去其他网址
- `redirect the recipient to a location` other than the Request-URI for completion.

```bash
# The general syntax is:
Location : absoluteURI

Location: https://www.tutorialspoint.org/ http/index.htm
# The Content-Location header field differs from Location in that the Content-Location identifies the original location of the entity enclosed in the request.
```

---

### Proxy-Authenticate 跟407一起发送
- must be included as a part of a `407 (Proxy Authentication Required) response`.

```bash
# The general syntax is:
Proxy-Authenticate  : challenge
```

---

### Retry-After 跟503一起 多久后service就会失效
- can be used with a `503 (Service Unavailable) response`
- to indicate `how long the service is expected to be unavailable` to the requesting client.

```bash
# The general syntax is:
Retry-After : HTTP-date | delta-seconds

Retry-After: Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT
Retry-After: 120
# In the latter example, the delay is 2 minutes.
```

---

### Server
- contains information about the software used by the origin server to handle the request.

```bash
# The general syntax is:
Server : product | comment

Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
# If the response is being forwarded through a proxy, the proxy application must not modify the Server response-header.
```

---

### Set-Cookie cookie的一些特性
- contains a `name/value pair of information to retain for this URL`.

```bash
# The general syntax is:
Set-Cookie: NAME=VALUE; OPTIONS
# Set-Cookie response header comprises the token Set-Cookie, followed by a comma-separated list of one or more cookies.

Set-Cookie: name1=value1,name2=value2; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
```


```bash
1	Comment=comment
# This option can be used to specify any comment associated with the cookie.

2	Domain=domain
# The Domain attribute specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid.

3	Expires=Date-time
# The date the cookie will expire. If it is blank, the cookie will expire when the visitor quits the browser.

4	Path=path
# The Path attribute specifies the subset of URLs to which this cookie applies.

5	Secure
# It instructs the user agent to return the cookie only under a secure connection.
```

---

### Vary 有些header根据网站不同会不同
- specifies that the entity has multiple sources
- and may therefore vary according to the specified list of request header(s).

```bash
Vary : field-name
# Here field names are case-insensitive.

Vary: Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding
# can specify multiple headers separated by commas and a value of asterisk "*" signals that unspecified parameters are not limited to the request-headers.
```

---

### WWW-Authenticate 跟401一期 用来用户认证
- must be included in `401 (Unauthorized) response messages`.
- The field value consists of at least one challenge that indicates `the authentication scheme(s) and parameters applicable to the Request-URI`.

```bash
# The general syntax is:
WWW-Authenticate : challenge
# WWW- Authenticate field value might contain more than one challenge, or if more than one WWW-Authenticate header field is provided, the contents of a challenge itself can contain a comma-separated list of authentication parameters
WWW-Authenticate: BASIC realm="Admin"
# Entity Headers
```

## entity-header field

### Allow 网页支持的http method
- lists the set of `methods supported by the resource` identified by the Request-URI.

```bash
# The general syntax is:
Allow : Method

Allow: GET, HEAD, PUT
# can specify multiple methods separated by commas.
# This field cannot prevent a client from trying other methods.
```

---

### Content-Encoding 回复内容的格式
- used as a modifier to the media-type.
- If the content-coding of an entity in a request message is not acceptable to the origin server, the server should respond with a status code of `415 (Unsupported Media Type)`.

```bash
# The general syntax is:
Content-Encoding : content-coding

# The content-coding is a characteristic of the entity identified by the Request-URI.
Content-Encoding: gzip
```

---

### Content-Language
- describes the natural language(s) of the intended audience for the enclosed entity.
- The primary purpose of Content-Language is to allow a user to identify and differentiate entities according to the user's own preferred language.

```bash
# Following is the general syntax:
Content-Language : language-tag

# Multiple languages may be listed for content that is intended for multiple audiences
Content-Language: mi, en
```

---

### Content-Length
- indicates the `size of the entity-body`, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient
- or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that would have been sent, had the request been a GET.

```bash
# The general syntax is:
Content-Length : DIGITS

Content-Length: 3495
Any Content-Length greater than or equal to zero is a valid value.

```

---

### Content-Location `entity-header field`
- supply the resource location for the entity enclosed in the message when that entity is accessible from a location separate from the requested resource's URI.

```bash
# The general syntax is:
Content-Location:  absoluteURI | relativeURI

Content-Location: https://www.tutorialspoint.org/ http/index.htm
# The value of Content-Location also defines the base URI for the entity.

```

---

### Content-MD5 `entity-header field`
- to supply an MD5 digest of the entity
- checking the integrity of the message upon receipt.

```bash
# The general syntax is:
Content-MD5  : md5-digest using base64 of 128 bit MD5 digest as per RFC 1864

Content-MD5  : 8c2d46911f3f5a326455f0ed7a8ed3b3
# The MD5 digest is computed based on the content of the entity-body, including any content-coding that has been applied, but not including any transfer-encoding applied to the message-body.

```

---

### Content-Range `entity-header field`
- sent with a partial entity-body to specify where in the `full entity-body` `the partial body` should be applied.

```bash
# The general syntax is:
Content-Range : bytes-unit [first-byte-pos]-[last-byte-pos]

# Examples of byte-content-range-spec values, assuming that the entity contains a total of 1234 bytes:

# - The first 500 bytes:
Content-Range : bytes 0-499/1234

# - The second 500 bytes:
Content-Range : bytes 500-999/1234

# - All except for the first 500 bytes:
Content-Range : bytes 500-1233/1234

# - The last 500 bytes:
Content-Range : bytes 734-1233/1234

# When an HTTP message includes the content of a single range, this content is transmitted with a Content-Range header,
# a Content-Length header showing the number of bytes actually transferred.
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial content
