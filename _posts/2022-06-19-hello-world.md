Hello! You are reading my first post! 

In the following days, I am going to post the thoughts about Mathematics/ML/NLP. And the updating routine is at least one post per week. There can be interesting visualization in every post to help you understand some complex concept easily. Just like the figure below[^1]:

{% include /figures/3d_conv.html %}

Last but not least, <b>acknowledge</b> and credits should be given to [Hummat](https://github.com/hummat) who provided the complete resources for building the 3D website, [Cotes](https://github.com/cotes2020) who provided the theme and [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) who built the jekyll-now. 

Kind Regards,<br>
Yunpeng Tai
