Found this in my archives. I was 17 years old junior at the American Community School Beirut. In 1991, the class was learning BASIC, which I knew already from elementary days. The lab instructor saw me bored, made me his assistant, and gave me the “Oh Pascal!” book. My first task was to write a memory editor. I wished he asked me to write a game instead. Anyway, that got me deeper into computer software. Years fly. We build new software and tackle the subsequent problems, but we always stay committed to our computing passion.
