## Prisma Cloud API

Prisma Cloud REST API
- `representational state transfer (REST) API` that Prisma Cloud supports.
- Application programming interfaces (APIs) allow one software program to communicate with another.
- The REST API works like a web server where an API call is made from a client and sent to a server.
- **REST uses the HTTP protocol** where data is exchanged using JSON structured data, and uses `HTTP methods POST, PUT, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE, and PATCH` to read and write data.

Prisma Cloud has a REST API that allows to configure custom integrations for cloud security needs.
1. Create Access Key
   1. Admin generates `Access Key` and `Secret Key`.
2. Submit Login API Request
   1. The user submits the `login API request` to generate the token and to receive the token back from the API call.
3. REST API Server
   1. Processes the `JSON Web Token (JWT) Request` and `returns the token` to the requester.
4. JWT Returned
   1. The JWT is valid for 10min, and must be refreshed for continued access to the Prisma Cloud API.
   2. If an API request is made with an expired JWT request, the request will return an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized response`
5. Use JWT
   1. The JWT then is used to authenticate all subsequent `REST API` requests on Prisma Cloud.
