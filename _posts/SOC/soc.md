## Security Operations Center (SOC) Overview

security operations center
- detects, analyzes, and responds to security events
- SOC will become the main entity responsible for cybersecurity goals and results.
- As a security hub, a SOC is a rich tapestry made up of people, data visibility, tools, integration with outside sources, and processes.
- All these elements are necessary to achieve and continuously improve security results.
- A SOC can be internal to an organization or hired as a managed service.


### Role of SOCs in an Organization

1. `Detection and Response Tools`
   - `endpoint detection and response (EDR)` tools: determine a response to alerts received from SIEMs.
   - specifically help detection, investigation, response, and prevention of endpoint threats.
   - They also focus specifically on endpoints and need to be chosen, bought, installed, learned, and maintained as a separate product for endpoints.

2. `Automation and Improvement`
   - SOCs track their own work for automation and continuous improvement for both SecOps and incident analysis and response.
   - These improvement and automation efforts work best with repeatable, documented, and modifiable workflows.

3. SEIMs and SOCs
   - `Security information and event managers (SIEMs)`
   - providing alerts for analysis, investigation, and remediation.


4. SOAR Products
   - `Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)`:
   - address both automation and continuous improvement.
   - facilitate the arrangement of tasks into a workflow.
   - automate tasks to speed up incident response.
