This weekend I spent the full 2 days to build a pair of EAA 1000 Workbench.

I started to buy material a few weeks ago from homedepot. Following the [online instruction](https://www.communitygroundworks.org/sites/default/files/workbench_plans_SA1.pdf), they
wants 2 pieces of 4x8 MDF boards. My mini-van is simply not big enough, so I opted to use 4 pieces 2x4 MDFs and it worked out fine.

The whole process is very straightforward, just a lot of cutting and drilling. It's a lot of manual labor work though. On the first day I borrowed my neighbor's table saw
and finished all the cutting.

And on the second day I started to glue/screw everything together. The process was a little slow in the morning, but I picked up speed in the
afternoon.



I was quite happy with the end result in the end, here is the finished tables.
