Ken Shirriff <a  target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/kenshirriff">@kenshirriff</a> shows a fantastic comparison between the original ARM processor that was originally created in 1983 for the Acorn computer with 25 thousand transitions and the now Apple M1 Arm with 16 billion transistors. The image of the dies below makes the 1985 Arm the size of one pixel in the M1. Apple invested in ARM since the beginning, and it is paying off with their new computers.
