# Intrusion detection system (IDS)

---

## IDS basic
- software / hardware system
- detect signs of malicious activity on network or individual computer.

IDS is designed to detect:

- **threats**:
  - `Masquerader 化装跳舞者`: falsely using the identity/credentials of a legitimate user to gain access to computer system/network.
  - `Misfeasor违法行为者`: legitimate user who performs actions he is not authorized to do
  - `Clandestine 暗中地 user`: user who tries to block/cover up his actions by deleting audit/system logs.

- **automated attacks and threats**:
  - `port scans`: information gathering, intended to determine which ports on a host are open for TCP connections
  - `Denial-of-service attacks`: network attacks meant to overwhelm a host and shut out legitimate accesses
  - `Malware attacks`: replicating malicious software attacks, like Trojan horses, computer worms, viruses, etc.
  - `ARP spoofing`: redirect IP traffic in a local-area network
  - `DNS cache poisoning`: a pharming attack, changing a host’s DNS cache to create a falsified domain-name/IP-address association.

## IDS components

- The functions of an IDS
  - `IDS sensors`:
    - collect real-time data about the functioning of network components and computers
  - `IDS manager`:
    - receives reports from sensors.
    - compiles data from the IDS sensors to determine if an intrusion has occurred.
    - This determination is usually based on a `set of site policies & rules and statistical conditions` that define probable intrusions.
    - If detects an intrusion, it sounds an alarm to system administrators

## Network-Based and Host-Based Solutions

### Network & Host IDS/IPS

**NIDS – Network Intrusion Detection System**
- Using a network tap, span port, or hub collects packets on the network
- Attempts to identify unauthorized, illicit, and anomalous behavior based on network traffic
- Methods:
  - signature file comparisons,
  - anomaly detection,
  - stateful protocol analysis
- Using the captured data, the IDS system processes and flags any suspicious traffic

**HIDS – Host Intrusion Detection System**
- Generally involves an agent installed on each system, monitoring and alerting on local OS and application activity
- Attempts to identify unauthorized, illicit, and anomalous behavior on a specific device/OS
- The installed agent uses a combination of signatures, rules, and heuristics to identify unauthorized activity
