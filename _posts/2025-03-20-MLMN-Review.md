*Front cover of the book*

Maybe Love, Maybe Not by Udai Yadla is a collection of short stories centered around the theme of *love. Udai emphasizes the role of love in human relationships—portraying it as a force powerful enough to fill any void in a person’s life. *"Life is all about sunshine and rain, and love is the rainbow," he mentions on the book’s cover.  

Interestingly, the book starts right away, without a preface or introduction. Since a preface often helps shape my initial impressions, I was a bit surprised by its absence. Nonetheless, I proceeded to read the first story.  

## MLMN: The Good Parts  
I have to say, the first story was pretty good and made a strong impression on me. The book explores almost every kind of love story I could imagine, with many stories featuring young characters or those working in the software industry (which makes sense, as I know the author personally). Despite this, most of the stories are engaging and have a feel-good essence.  

Udai pays close attention to subtle moments between characters, making the stories immersive and interesting. His wordplay in certain sections was so well-executed that it filled me with positive emotions. However, I felt that some "categories" of love were missing—what about love between introverts?  

## Parts I Didn't Like  
While the book generally maintains a pleasant tone, a few stories felt like hiccups. The ghost stories didn’t quite convince me, and the one where the protagonist gets scammed didn’t either. Though they are decent, they felt like local minima in the overall experience.  

## Should You Read It?  
Absolutely! The book appeals to a young audience, and anyone who enjoys indulging in nostalgic, fictional love stories should give it a try. At around 190 pages, it’s a short read—perfect for reading a story before bed.  

*My rating: 8.5/10*
