One important photo that I feel any developer would appreciate is the first lines of assembly code that formed the BASIC language compiler on the first Altair personal computer written by Bill Gates and the late Paul Allen. It can be seen at the Microsoft Redmond Campus Museum. Such lines of code sparked the generation of software developers across the world, including me.
