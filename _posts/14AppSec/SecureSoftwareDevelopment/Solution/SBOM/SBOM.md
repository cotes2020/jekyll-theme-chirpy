## Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

SBOMs are extremely important because you can't protect what you don't know exists

By having an SBOM, you can start to understand:

- What is in your application
- What is in your dependencies
- What makes up your supply chain
- Which components are OSS
- Which components are outdated
- Which are vulnerable
- Etc...

It should be integrated into your SDLC, Maintaining an up-to-date SBOM helps organizations track changes in their software’s supply chain, including component versions, dependencies, and vulnerabilities, ensuring better visibility and security.
