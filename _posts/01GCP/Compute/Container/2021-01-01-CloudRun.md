- <font color=red> serverless </font>

- enables you to deploy <font color=red> stateless </font> **containers**
  - run container using a single command
  - that listen for requests or events delivered via HTTP requests.

- builds, deploys, and manages modern stateless workloads.
  - can build the applications in any language using whatever frameworks and tools
  - deploy them in seconds without manage and maintain the server infrastructure.
    - distracts way all the infrastructure management
    - such as provisioning, configuring, managing those servers
    - only focus on developing applications.
  - run request or event driven stateless workloads
    - without having to worry bout servers.

- automatically scales up and down from zero
  - depending upon traffic almost instantaneously
  - no worry about scale configuration.

- pay for only the resources used
  - calculated down to the nearest 100 milliseconds.
  - no pay for those over provisioned resources.

- gives the choice of running the **containers**
  - with fully managed or in the own GKE cluster.
  - deploy the stateless containers with a consistent developer experience to a fully managed environment or to the own GKE cluster.
  - This common experiences enabled by Knative
    - Cloud Run is built on Knative
      - an open source Kubernetes based platform.
      - an open API and runtime environment built on top of Kubernetes.

- gives the freedom to move the workloads across different environments and platforms,
  - either fully managed on GCP, on GKE
  - or anywhere a Knative runs.




- `GKE` = multiple `CloudRun`
