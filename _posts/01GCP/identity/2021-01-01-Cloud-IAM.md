- define a hierarchy to create trust boundaries in resource isolation

### project

  - creating and using resources and services, and managing billing APIs, and permissions.

- The GCP resources must belong to a project.

- Projects can be easily created, managed, deleted, or even recovered from accidental deletions.

- labels are changeable, project ID and project number remain fixed.
  - unique project ID and project number.
  - can name the project and apply labels for filtering.
