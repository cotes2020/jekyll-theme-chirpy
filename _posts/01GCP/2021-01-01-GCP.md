GCP offers four main kinds of services:
- compute, storage, big data and machine learning.

## interact with Google Cloud

![Screen Shot 2021-02-03 at 15.29.56](https://i.imgur.com/VPu8vIk.png)

4 ways to interact with Google Cloud
- Google Cloud Console
  - web user interface
  - ![Screen Shot 2021-02-10 at 22.01.19](https://i.imgur.com/hONolff.png)
- Cloud SDK and Cloud Shell
  - command-line interface
    * `gcloud`: Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and many Google Cloud services
    * `gsutil`: Cloud Storage
    * `kubectl`: GKE and Kubernetes
    * `bq`: BigQuery
  - Cloud Shell
    - command-line access to cloud resources directly from browser.
      - Web preview functionality
    - Cloud SDK command-line tools always available, up to date, and fully authenticated.
      * Preinstalled Cloud SDK and other tools
    - ephemeral compute engine virtual machine instance
    - built-in authorization for access to Cloud Console project and resource
    - Temporary Compute Engine VM
      - 5 GB of persistent disk storage (`$HOME dir`)
    - Language support for Java, Go, Python, Node.js, PHP, and Ruby
  - After 1 hour of inactivity, the Cloud Shell instance is recycled.
    - Only the `/home` directory persists.
    - Any changes made to the system configuration, including environment variables, are lost between sessions.

- Cloud Console mobile app
  - For iOS and Android
- REST-based API
  - for custom application


> creating environment variables is a good practice. You can easily and consistently re-use these environment variables, which makes your work less error-prone.

## API

![Screen Shot 2021-02-09 at 00.38.36](https://i.imgur.com/Z0xoKOL.png)

Application Programming Interfaces, APIs
- A software services implementation can be complex and changeable.
- to use that service
  - instead other pieces of software had to know internal details about how they worked
  - application developers structure the software, so that it presents a clean, well-defined interface that abstracts away needless details and then they document that interface.
  - That's an API.
- The underlying implementation can change as long as the interface doesn't
  - and other pieces of software that use the API don't have to know or care.
  - to change an API (add or deprecate a feature)
    - version the APIs.
      - To make the API change cleanly
      - API v2 might contain calls that v1 does not.
    - Programs that consume the API can specify the API version that they want to use in their calls.

- Supporting API, Google Cloud platform provides two API management tools.
  - Cloud Endpoints
  - Apigee Edge

---


### Cloud Endpoints
- Suppose
  - you're developing a software service and one of GCP's backends.
  - to make it easy to expose this API.
  - an easy way to monitor and log its use.

- to create and maintain APIs
  - an easy to deploy proxy in front of the software service

- Distributed API management through an API console
  - provides an API console
  - implements those capabilities in an easy-to-manage interface.

- expose the API using a RESTful interface

- <font color=red> supports applications running in GCP's compute platforms </font> in the languages and the client technologies.
  - Runtime environment
    - App Engine Flexible environment
    - Kubernetes Engine
    - Compute Engine
  - Clients
    - Android
    - iOS
    - Javascript
- control access and validate calls with JSON Web Tokens and Google API keys
  - identify web, mobile users with Auth0 and Firebase Authentication
  - to make sure it's only consumed by other developers whom you trust.
  - for the API to have a single coherent way for it to know which end user is making the call.
- generate client libraries


---

### Apigee Edge
- a platform
  - for developing and managing API proxies.
  - for making APIs available to the customers and partners
- It has a different orientation though.
- Contains analytics, monetization, and a developer portal
- focus on business problems
  - like rate limiting, quotas, and analytics.
- <font color=red> Many users of Apigee Edge are providing a software service to other companies </font> and those features come in handy.
  - do business analytics and billing on a customer-facing API
- Because of the backend services for Apigee Edge need not be in GCP
  - engineers often use it when they are "taking apart" a legacy application.
  - Instead of replacing a monolithic application in one risky move
    - they use Apigee Edge to peel off its services one by one,
    - standing up microservices to implement each in turn,
    - until the legacy application can be finally retired.
