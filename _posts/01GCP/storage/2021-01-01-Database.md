# Database

---


## basic


relational database services
- use a database schema to help your application keep your data consistent and correct.
- Another feature of relational database services that helps with the same goal - transactions.
  - application can designate a group of database changes as all or nothing.
  - Either they all get made, or none do.
    - Without database transactions
    - online bank wouldn't be able to offer you the ability to move money from one account to another.
    - What if,
    - after subtracting $10,000 from one of your accounts,
    - some glitch prevented it from adding that 10,000 to the destination account?
    - Your bank would have just misplaced $10,000.

NoSQL
- **Datastore** is best for `semi-structured application data that is used in app engine application`.
- **Bigtable** is best for `running large analytical workloads`.
- **Firestore** is ideal for b`uilding client-side mobile and web applications`.
- **Firebase Realtime Database** is best for `syncing data between users in real time, such as for collaboration apps`.
- **Memorystore** is an in-memory datastore that’s typically used to `speed up applications by caching frequently requested data`.




- <font color=red> Cloud Bigtable </font> `NoSQL`
  - store <font color=blue> large amount of structured objects </font>
  - with <font color=blue> lookups based on a single key </font>
  - does not support SQL's queries
  - does not support multi-row transactions.
  - provides `petabytes` of capacity
  - maximum unit size of 10 megabytes per cell and 100 megabytes per row.
  - use case
    - best for analytical data with <font color=blue> heavy read/write events </font>
    - like AdTech, Financial or IoT data.
    - devices with sensors and need to stream huge amounts of data from these devices to a storage option in the cloud


- <font color=red> Cloud Storage </font> `Blobstore`
  - provides `petabytes` of capacity
  - maximum unit size of five terabytes per object.
  - often the ingestion point for data being moved into the cloud
  - is frequently the long-term storage location for data
  - use case:
    - best for <font color=blue> structured and unstructured, binary or object data </font>
    - store immutable blobs larger than 10 megabytes
    - such as large images, movies, large media files and backups.
    - application that transcodes large video files.
  - <font color=blue> Immutable binary objects </font>
    - and new versions overwrite old unless


- <font color=red> Cloud SQL </font> `Relational`
  - full SQL support for an online transaction processing
  - provides `terabytes` of capacity
  - use case:
    - best for <font color=blue> web frameworks and in existing applications </font>
    - like storing user credentials and customer orders.


- <font color=red> Cloud Spanner  </font> `Relational`
  - full SQL support for an online transaction processing system.
  - provides `petabytes`.
  - application needs to store data with strong transactional consistency, and want seamless scaling up
  - use case:
    - If Cloud SQL does not fit the requirements as need horizontal scalability not just through read replicas
    - best for large scale database applications that are larger than two terabytes;
    - for example, for financial trading and e-commerce use cases.


- <font color=red> BigQuery </font>
  - it sits on the edge between data storage and data processing
  - use case:
    - to use its <font color=blue> big data analysis and interactive query and capabilities </font>
  - will not use BigQuery,
    - for example, as the backings store for an online application.

  - Data stored in BigQuery is highly durable.
    - Google stores the data in a replicated manner by default and at no additional charge for replicas.
  - pay only for the resources you use.
    - Data storage in BigQuery is inexpensive.
    - Queries incur charges based on the amount of data they process:
      - when you submit a query, you pay for the compute nodes only for the duration of that query.
      - You don't have to pay to keep a compute cluster up and running.

  - Using BigQuery involves interacting with a number of Google Cloud Platform resources,
    - including projects (covered elsewhere in this course), datasets, tables, and jobs.
      - **Datasets:**
        - a grouping mechanism that holds zero or more tables.
        - the lowest level unit of access control.
        - Datasets are owned by GCP projects.
        - Each dataset can be shared with individual users.
      - **Tables:**
        - A table is a row-column structure that contains actual data.
        - Each table has a schema that describes strongly typed columns of values.
        - Each table belongs to a dataset.

## Relational

### Cloud SQL

**relational databases**
- lot of work to set up, maintain, manage, and administer.
- If that doesn't sound like a good use of your time but you still want the protections of a relational database, consider Google Cloud SQL


**Google Cloud SQL**
- run your own database server
  - run the database server inside a Compute Engine virtual machine,

- offers choice of the MySQL or PostgreSQL database engines
  - a fully managed service.
  - capable of handling terabytes of storage.
  - If you’re currently using `MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server`, then Cloud SQL is your best bet.

#### benefit of Cloud SQL instances

- <font color=red> provides several replica services </font>
  - like read, failover, and external replicas.
  - if an outage occurs, Cloud SQL can replicate data between multiple zones with automatic failover.

- <font color=red> Cloud SQL backup the data </font>
  - either on-demand or scheduled backups.

- <font color=red> It can scale both vertically and horizontally </font>
  - vertically by changing the machine type,
  - horizontally via read replicas.

- <font color=red> security perspective </font>
  - Cloud SQL instances include network firewalls,
  - and customer data is encrypted when on Google's internal networks, and when stored in database tables, temporary files, and backups.

- <font color=red> Cloud SQL instances is accessible by other GCP services and even external services. </font>
  - You can authorize `Compute Engine instances` for access `Cloud SQL instances`
  - and configure the `Cloud SQL instance` to be in the same zone as your virtual machine.

- <font color=red> Cloud SQL also supports other applications and tools </font>
  - like SQL WorkBench, Toad,
  - and other external applications using standard MySQL drivers.

## NoSQL


### Cloud Bigtable

> relational database
> - use tables
> - every row has the same set of columns,
> - enforced database schema:
>   - the database engine, enforces rule and other rules you specify for each table.
> - big help for some applications but a huge pain for others.
>   - Some applications call for a much more flexible approach.
>   - example
>     - NoSQL schema.
>     - for applications that not all the rows might need to have the same columns.


- GCP fully manages the surface
  - no need to configure and tune it.

- NoSQL, big data database service.
  - databases in Bigtable are sparsely populated tables
  - can scale to billions of rows and thousands of columns
  - allowing you to store petabytes of data.

- ideal for
  - <font color=red> data that has a single lookup key </font>
    - Bigtable as a persistent hash table.
  - <font color=red> storing large amounts of data with very low latency </font>
    - supports high throughput
      - both read and write,
    - great choice for both operational and analytical applications
      - including Internet of Things, user analytics and financial data analysis.

- Cloud Bigtable is offered through the same open source API as HBase
  - HBase: the native database for the Apache Hadoop project.
  - having the same API enables portability of applications between HBase and Bigtable.

benefits
- <font color=red>scalability </font>
  - compare with own Apache HBase installation,
  - manage your own Hbase installation
    - scaling past a certain rate of queries per second is going to be tough,
  - Bigtable:
    - just increase the machine count which doesn't even require downtime.

- Cloud Bigtable <font color=red> handles administration tasks </font>
  - like upgrades and restarts transparently.

- <font color=red> encryption </font>
  - All data in Cloud Bigtable is encrypted in both in-flight and at rest.

- <font color=red> use IAM permissions </font>
  - to control who has access to Bigtable data.

- Bigtable is the same database that powers many of Google's core services
  - including search, analytics, maps and Gmail.
  - Cloud Bigtable is part of the GCP ecosystem, it can interact with other GCP services and third-party clients.



#### Bigtable Access Patterns

![Screen Shot 2021-02-04 at 00.09.22](https://i.imgur.com/HHrenvO.png)

- application API
  - data can be read from and written through data service layer
  - like Managed VMs, the HBase rest server or a Java server using the HBase client.
  - Typically, this will be to serve data to applications, dashboards and data services.

- streaming
  - Data can be streamed in through popular stream processing frameworks,
  - like Cloud Dataflow Streaming, Spark Streaming and Storm.

- batch processing
  - data can be read from and written through batch processes
  - like Hadoop map reduce, Dataflow or Spark.
  - Often, summarized or newly calculated data is written back to Cloud Bigtable or to a downstream database.

### Cloud Datastore

- highly scalable NoSQL database for the applications
  - store <font color=blue> unstructured objects </font>
  - support for `transactions`
  - support for `SQL-like queries`.
  - provides `terabytes` of capacity
  - maximum unit size of one megabyte per entity.

- use cases
  - store data from App Engine apps.
    - best for semi-structured application data that is used in  <font color=blue> app engine applications </font>
    - free daily quota, separate from any free trials
  - build solutions that <font colore=blue> span App Engine and Compute Engine </font> with Cloud Datastore as the integration point.
  - fully-managed service
  - automatically handles sharding and replication,
    - providing a highly available and durable database
    - scales automatically to handle load.

- Unlike Cloud Bigtable
  - Cloud Datastore offers transactions that affect multiple database rows
  - it lets you do SQL-like queries.
  - Cloud Datastore has a free daily quota that provides storage, reads, writes, deletes and small operations at no charge.
