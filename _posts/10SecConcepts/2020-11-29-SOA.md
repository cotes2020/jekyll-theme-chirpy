## SOA, Service-Oriented Systems

![2-5-1](https://i.imgur.com/RgPwkdd.png)

1. **Business Services**: `core buniess operation`
   - Coarse-grained services that define core business operations.
   - Represented through XML, Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), and others.


2. **Enterprise Services**:
   - Implement the functionality defined by business services.
   - Mainly rely on application services and infrastructure services to fulfill business requests.


3. **Application Services**: `core application function for the server`
   - Fine-grained services that are confined to a specific application context.
   - A dedicated user interface can directly invoke the services.


4. **Infrastructure Services**:
   - Implement non-functional tasks such as `authentication, auditing, security, and logging`.
   - Can be invoked from either application services or enterprise services.

## Microservices

Microservices have limited service taxonomy.

They consist of two service types, as depicted below.

![2-1-768x624](https://i.imgur.com/xh5664s.png)

**Functional Services**:
- Support specific business operations.
- Accessing of services is done externally and these services are not shared with other services.

**infrastructure services**:
- implement tasks such as auditing, security, and logging.
- In this, the services are not unveiled to the outside world.

### Microservices vs SOA

![2-5](https://i.imgur.com/gSvYanL.png)

![Asset-25-1](https://i.imgur.com/iP1YHXQ.png)

- **monolith**:
  - similar to a big container wherein all the software components of an application are assembled together and tightly packaged.
  - single point of failure, no scalability,
  - slow development

- **SOA Service-oriented architecture**: a collection of services.
  - coarse-grained
  - These services communicate with each other.
  - The communication can involve either simple data passing or two or more services coordinating some activity.
  - Some means of connecting services to each other is needed.
  - 4 feature 4 servers.

- **Microservices**: `task level`
  - fine-grained
  - an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small autonomous services modeled around a business domain.

| Importance is on business functionality reuse             | Importance is on the concept of “bounded context”                                        |
| They have common governance and standards                 | They focus on people, collaboration and freedom of other options                         |
| Uses `Enterprise Service bus (ESB)` for communication     | `Simple messaging system`                                                                |
| They support multiple message protocols                   | They use lightweight protocols such as HTTP/REST etc.                                    |
| Multi-threaded with more overheads to handle I/O          | Single-threaded usually with the use of Event Loop features for non-locking I/O handling |
| Maximizes application service reusability                 | Focuses on decoupling                                                                    |
| Traditional Relational Databases are more often used      | Modern Relational Databases are more often used                                          |
| A systematic change requires modifying the monolith       | A systematic change is to create a new service                                           |
| DevOps / Continuous Delivery is becoming popular, but not yet mainstream | Strong focus on DevOps / Continuous Delivery                              |

### Major Differences Between Microservices and SOA

1. **Service Granularity** 间隔尺寸 :
   - microservices: Service components are generally `single-purpose services` that do one thing really, really well.
   - SOA, service components can range in `size anywhere from small application services to very large enterprise services`.
   - In fact, it is common to have a service component within SOA represented by a large product or even a subsystem.

2. **Component Sharing**:
   - SOA
     - Component sharing is one of the core tenets of SOA.
     - component sharing is what enterprise services are all about.
     - SOA enhances component sharing,
   - MSA tries to minimize on sharing through `“bounded context”`
     - A `bounded context` refers to the `coupling of a component and its data` as a `single unit with minimal dependencies`.
   - As SOA relies on multiple services to fulfill a business request, systems built on SOA are likely to be slower than MSA.

2. **Middleware vs API layer**:
   - microservices architecture pattern has `API layer`,
     - API layer between services and service consumers.
   - SOA has a `messaging middleware` component.
     - The messaging middleware in SOA offers a host of additional capabilities not found in MSA,
     - including `mediation and routing, message enhancement, message, and protocol transformation`.

3. **Remote services**:
   - SOA architectures rely on `messaging (AMQP, MSMQ)` and `SOAP` as primary remote access protocols.
   - Most MSAs rely on two protocols – `REST and simple messaging (JMS, MSMQ)`,
     - the protocol found in MSA is usually homogeneous.



4. **Heterogeneous interoperability**:
   - SOA promotes the propagation of multiple heterogeneous protocols through its messaging middleware component.
   - MSA attempts to simplify the architecture pattern by reducing the number of choices for integration.
   - `to integrate several systems using different protocols in a heterogeneous environment`, consider SOA.
   - `If services could be exposed and accessed through the same remote access protocol`, MSA is a better option.
   - ![Screen Shot 2020-11-29 at 16.57.28](https://i.imgur.com/sGOvK1X.png)



depends on the purpose of the application you are building.
- SOA
  - better suited for `large and complex business application environments` that require integration with many heterogeneous applications;
  - smaller applications are not a good fit for SOA as they don’t need a messaging middleware component.
- Microservices
  - better suited for `smaller and well-partitioned, web-based systems`
  - microservices give greater control as a developer.
  - break server/feature in to `task level services`
