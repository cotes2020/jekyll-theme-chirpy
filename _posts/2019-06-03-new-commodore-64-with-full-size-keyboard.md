Subsequent geeky announcements can’t get any better these few days. I posted about the Raspberry Pi 4.0 release earlier, and now much more exciting news for me is the upcoming release of a new Commodore 64 with a full-size keyboard later this year. The c64 was the hottest home computer in the 80s. As a kid, it took me years to get my own. The new full size to be released in Dec 2019 will expand on the c64mini that was recently released and is still fun to play or code with, even with its fake miniature keys. (I will blog about that one soon). However, this will full-fledged version with the exactly full-size keys that shaped our coding and gaming childhood. Check it out:
