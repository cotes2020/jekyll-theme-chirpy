## **Day 1: Fundamentals of Large Language Models**

- **9:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Lecture**

   + During this lecture, you will develop a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts underlying language models. 
  
      The session will provide a comprehensive overview of language modeling basics, as well as the evolutionary journey of
      approaches within this domain. We will explore the progression from rule-based systems to
      the revolutionary attention mechanism and the subsequent models built upon it, such as
      Transformers. By delving into the intricacies of these modern Transformers-based language
      models, you  will discover the remarkable power they possess and gain insights into
      how they have become the state-of-the-art technology in the field of nlp.

- **12:00 PM - 1:00 PM: Lunch Break**

- **1:00 PM - 4:00 PM: Coding Tutorial: Introduction to Transformer Models**

  + During this hands-on tutorial, you will learn how to implement and utilise
    `Transformer` models for various NLP tasks. You will be guided through the process of setting
    up the required software environment, loading and `fine-tuning` pretrained `Transformer`
    models, and applying them to solve specific research problems in social sciences. Practical
    exercises and coding examples will be provided.

## **Day 2: Model Interpretation and Debiasing**

- **9:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Lecture**

    + This lecture will focus on techniques for interpreting the outputs of language models.
    You will learn about methods such as `attention visualization` and `saliency mapping` to
    understand how the models make predictions. Additionally, the session will cover the topic
    of `model bias`, its impact on social science research, and strategies to detect and mitigate
    bias in language models.

- **12:00 PM - 1:00 PM: Lunch Break**

- **1:00 PM - 4:00 PM: Coding Tutorial: Interpreting and Debiasing Language Models**

    + During this tutorial, participants will have the opportunity to apply the concepts covered in
    the lecture to interpret and debias language models. They will gain hands-on experience
    with various interpretation techniques and learn how to evaluate and address biases in
    model predictions. We will provide you with practical exercises and examples.

## **Day 3: Recent Developments: Large Language Models and Alignment**

- **9:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Lecture**

    + In this lecture, we will focus on recent advancements in language models, specifically the
    emergence of large-scale models and the intriguing concept of reinforcement learning from
    human feedback (`RLHF`). You will have the opportunity to explore the capabilities
    and limitations of these powerful language models. We will delve into the concept of `RLHF`,
    discussing how it plays a pivotal role in improving model performance and aligning them
    with human feedback. Furthermore, we will cover the generation of `InstructGPT` models,
    including the highly popular `ChatGPT`. Through detailed examples and case studies,
    you will gain insights into the creation process and understand how these models
    can be effectively utilized. By the end of this session, you will have a comprehensive
    understanding of `RLHF`, along with practical knowledge of building and leveraging
    `InstructGPT` models like `ChatGPT`.

- **12:00 PM - 1:00 PM: Lunch Break**

- **1:00 PM - 4:00 PM: Coding Tutorial: Advanced Techniques with Large Language Models and
Alignment**

     + During this tutorial, you will explore advanced techniques with large language
    models and `RLHF`. You will gain hands-on experience with fine-tuning large-scale models
    using `RLHF` methods. Practical examples and exercises will be provided to help you
    apply these techniques to your own research questions and datasets.

 - **4:00 PM - 6 PM: Coding challange**

    + You will be grouped together into a set of teams to tackle a challenging reasearch problem. Winning this competition isn't solely about reaching the correct solution; it's about pushing boundaries and thinking outside the box. We're looking for the most creative, efficient, and innovative solutions. We will reward (there will be nice small prises!) the team that exhibits outstanding creativity and innovation and the team that delivers the best result. This is a great platform to test your skills, solidify your networks, cooperate with peers, and dive deep into the thrilling world of language models!
