## Introduction

Hello Everyone! I am Kishan Parekh. Welcome to my technology blog.

I created this blog to share my experiences dealing with various technologies, through my work and personally. Since I am an Oracle Database Consultant, my primary experiences will be in databases, but of late I am delving into new cloud based technologies.

This is my first foray into blogging and I hope to provide helpful tips thoughts through my articles. In fact, I am learning to build this site and will likely add a post on how I am doing it.

Since this site is in development, I aim to add more functionalities as I gain more experience.
Feedback will be greatly appreciated (once I learn how to add a comment box &#128513; )
