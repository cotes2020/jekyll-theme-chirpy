I saw an interesting blog post at [boingboing.net](https://boing) today: [Booting DOS from vinyl](https://boingboing.net/2020/11/23/booting-dos-from-vinyl.html). The original blog post is by [Bogin, JR - Booting from a vinyl record](http://boginjr.com/it/sw/dev/vinyl-boot/). The author walks through capturing audio of vinyl playing DOS code and then processing it as a DOS boot process like a cassette player. It is pretty cool.
