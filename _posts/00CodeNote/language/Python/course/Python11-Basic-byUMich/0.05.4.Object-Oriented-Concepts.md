# Object-oriented programming 面向对象编程 `class&Instance`

Python is an `object-oriented programming` language.
- provides features that support `object-oriented programming (OOP)`.


`procedural programming` 面向过程
- focus is on writing function/procedure which operate on data.
- 把计算机程序 视为一系列的命令集合，即一组函数的顺序执行。
- 为了简化程序设计，面向过程把函数继续切分为子函数，即把大块函数通过切割成小块函数来降低系统的复杂度。


`Object Oriented Programming - OOP 面向对象`的程序设计
- focus is on the creation of objects which contain both data and functionality together.
- 一种程序设计思想。
- 把`Object`作为程序的基本单元
- 一个`Object`包含了数据和操作数据的函数。
- 把 计算机程序 视为一组对象的集合，而每个对象都可以接收其他对象发过来的消息，并处理这些消息，计算机程序的执行就是一系列消息在各个对象之间传递。

在Python中，所有数据类型都可以视为Object，当然也可以自定义对象。
- 自定义的对象数据类型就是面向对象中的类（`Class`）的概念。

### `面向过程`和`OOP`在程序流程上的不同之处。

处理学生的成绩表

1. `面向过程`的程序

    ```py
    # 为了表示一个学生的成绩，用一个dict表示：
    std1 = { 'name': 'Michael', 'score': 98 }
    std2 = { 'name': 'Bob', 'score': 81 }
    # 处理学生成绩可以通过函数实现，比如打印学生的成绩：
    def print_score(std):
        print('%s: %s' % (std['name'], std['score']))
    ```

2. `面向对象`的程序设计思想

   - 首选思考的不是程序的执行流程，而是Student这种数据类型应该被视为一个对象，这个对象拥有name和score这两个属性（`Property`）。
   - 如果要打印一个学生的成绩
     - 首先创建出学生对应的对象，

      ```py
      class Student(object):
          def __init__(self, name, score):
              self.name = name
              self.score = score
          def print_score(self):
              print('%s: %s' % (self.name, self.score))

      bart = Student('Bart Simpson', 59)
      lisa = Student('Lisa Simpson', 87)
      ```

     - 然后，给对象发一个print_score消息，让对象自己把自己的数据打印出来。
       - 给对象发消息实际上就是调用`对象对应的关联函数`
       - 称之为`对象的方法（Method）`。

      ```py
      bart.print_score()
      lisa.print_score()
      ```

`面向对象`的设计思想是从自然界中来的，因为在自然界中，类（Class）和实例（Instance）的概念是很自然的。
- `Class`是一种抽象概念，比如我们定义的Class——Student，是指学生这个概念
- 而实例（`Instance`）则是一个个具体的Student，比如，Bart Simpson和Lisa Simpson是两个具体的Student。

所以，面向对象的设计思想是抽象出`Class`，根据`Class`创建`Instance`。
- 面向对象的抽象程度又比函数要高，因为一个Class既包含数据，又包含操作数据的方法

# 5.4.1. User-defined Classes

Python provides a way to define `new functions` in programs, it also provides a way to `define new classes of objects`.

---

## Class

- an entity
- determines how an object will behave and what the object will contain.
- a blueprint or a set of instruction to build a specific type of object.
- It provides initial values for member variables and member functions or methods.

---

## Object

- a self-contained component
- consists of methods and properties to make a data useful.
- helps to determines the behavior of the class.
- For example
  - send a message to an object
  - asking the object to invoke or execute one of its methods.

- From a programming point of view, an object can be a data structure, a variable, or a function that has a memory location allocated.
- The object is designed as class hierarchies.


User creatable objects
- In a user program, only objects belonging to certain classes can be created directly.
- In the class hierarchy chart, the yellow boxes denote these user-instantiable classes.
- The other classes fall into one of four categories:
  - Non-instantiable superclasses such as Base and View
  - Classes designed to function only as composite class members, such as PlotManager and subclasses of the Transformation class
  - The classes that can have only one instance, such as Error and Workspace; they are automatically instantiated when the HLU library is initialized
  - Classes that are instantiated by certain objects for a specialized purpose on behalf of the user; these currently include the XyDataSpec and AnnoManager classes

Dynamically associated objects
- In addition to the class hierarchy and composite class relationships, the HLU library has a mechanism that allows you to associate independently-created View objects dynamically. You can "overlay" Transform class objects onto a plot object's data space. You can also make any View object into an "annotation" of a plot object. The combination of the base plot object, its overlays, and its annotations acts in many ways like a single object. Plot objects, overlays, and annotations are discussed in the PlotManager class module, and also in the AnnoManager class module.

---


### Class hierarchy versus instance hierarchy
Besides the class hierarchy of subclasses derived from the Base superclass, you should be aware that the HLU library defines an "instance hierarchy" of the objects that are created in the course of executing an HLU program. These two hierarchies are completely distinct, and you should be careful not confuse them.
Whenever you create an object, you must specify the object's "parent" as one of the parameters to the create call. Each object you create is therefore the "child" of some parent object. The initial parent, the "ancestor" of all the objects created, must be an "application" (App) object. Depending on the call used to initialize the HLU library, you may need to create this object yourself, or the library may automatically create it for you.

The instance hierarchy is significant in the following ways:

When you destroy a parent object all its children are destroyed along with it.
A View object must have a Workstation class ancestor that supplies the viewspace on which it is drawn.
The resource database uses the instance hierarchy to determine how resource specifications in resource files apply to particular objects in an HLU program.

# difference between class and object:

| **Class**                                                   | **Object**                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `template` for creating objects in program.                 | an instance of a class.                                      |
| `logical entity`                                            | Object is a physical entity                                  |
| `does not allocate memory space` when it is created.        | Object allocates memory space when been created.             |
| You can declare class only once.                            | can create more than one object using a class.               |
| Example: Car.                                               | Example: Jaguar, BMW, Tesla, etc.                            |
| Class generates objects                                     | Objects provide life to the class.                           |
| `can't be manipulated` as they are not available in memory. | can be manipulated.                                          |
| `doesn't have any values` associated with the fields.       | Each and every object has values associated with the fields. |
| create class by "class" keyword. `Class XX {}`              | create object by "new" keyword. `XX aa= new XX()`            |

## Types of Class

- <font color=red> Derived Classes and Inheritance </font>
  - A derived class is a class which is created or derived from other remaining class.
  - It is used for increasing the functionality of base class.
  - This type of class derives and inherits properties from existing class.
  - It can also add or share/extends its own properties.

1. <font color=red> Superclasses </font>
   - A superclass is a class from which you can derive many sub classes.

2. <font color=red> Subclasses </font>
   - A subclass is a class that derives from superclass.

3. <font color=red> Mixed classes </font>
   - combine the functionality from other classes into a new class.
     - inherit the properties of one class to another.
   - It uses a subset of the functionality of class, whereas a derive class uses the complete set of superclass functionality.
   - different
     - A mixed class
       - manages the properties of other classes
       - and may only use a subset of the functionality of a class
     - a derived class
       - uses the complete set of functionality of its superclasses
       - and usually extends this functionality.

## Uses of Class

- Class is used to <font color=red> hold both data variables and member functions </font>
- for <font color=red> create user define objects </font>
  - provides a way to organize information about data.
- can use class to <font color=red> inherit the property of other class </font>
- take advantage of <font color=red> constructor or destructor </font>
- can be used for a large amount of data and complex applications.

---

## Use of Object

- <font color=red> give the type of message accepted and the type of returned responses </font>
- use an object to <font color=red> access a piece of memory using an object reference variable </font>
- <font color=red> It is used to manipulate data </font>
- Objects represent <font color=red> a real-world problem </font> for which you are finding a solution.
- It enables data members and member functions to perform the desired task.

# example

## OOPs in Python


> Class > Instance > Instance variables/Attributes > Methods

1. import <font color=red> class </font> like `Turtle` or `Screen`

2. create a new <font color=red> instance </font>

    ```py
    import Turtles

    # make a new window for turtles to paint in
    wn = turtle.Screen()
    # make a new turtle
    alex = turtle.Turtle()
    ```

   - `alex = turtle.Turtle()`
   - The Python interpreter find that `Turtle` is a <font color=blue> class, not function </font>
   - so it <font color=blue> creates a new instance of the class </font> and returns it.
     - Since the Turtle class was defined in a separate module, (confusingly, also named turtle)
     - had to refer to the class as `turtle.Turtle`.




3. Each instance can have <font color=red> attributes / instance variables </font>

    ```py
    # For example
    # the following code would print out 1100.

    alex.price = 500
    tess.price = 600
    print(alex.price + tess.price)
    ```
    - use `=` to assign values to an attribute


4. <font color=red> Classes have associated methods </font>

    ```py
    alex.forward(50)
    ```

    - The interpreter looks up `alex`
    - finds `alex` is an <font color=blue> instance of the class </font> `Turtle`.
    - Then it looks up the <font color=blue> attribute </font> `forward`
    - finds that it is a <font color=blue> method </font>
      - `Methods` return `values`, like `functions`
      - However, none of the methods of the `Turtle class` return values the way the `len` function does.
    - the interpreter invokes the method, passing 50 as a **parameter**.


The only difference between <font color=red> invocation </font> and <font color=red> function calls </font>
- the `object instance` itself is also passed as a parameter.
- Thus `alex.forward(50)` moves `alex`, while `tess.forward(50)` moves `tess`.

## OOPs in Java: Classes and Objects

> design any program using this OOPs approach.



To developing a pet management system, specially meant for dogs.

declared a class called Dog
1. need to <font color=red> model dogs into software entities </font>
   - <img alt="pic" src="https://i.imgur.com/Ditinne.jpg" width="400">


2. need various information about the dogs
   - List down the differences between them.
   - <img alt="pic" src="https://i.imgur.com/WHebHfY.jpg" width="400">
   - differences are also some common characteristics shared by these dogs.
   - These characteristics (breed, age, size, color) can form a data members for your object.



3. list out the common behaviors of these dogs
   - like sleep, sit, eat, etc.
   - So these will be the actions of our software objects.
   - <img alt="pic" src="https://i.imgur.com/0fRi8B6.jpg" width="400">

4. So far we have defined following things,

   - **Class**: Dogs
   - **Data member / objects**: size, age, color, breed, etc.
   - **Methods**: eat, sleep, sit and run.

   - <img alt="pic" src="https://i.imgur.com/kBcpE3f.jpg" width="400">





5. for different values of data members (breed size, age, and color) in Java class, you will get different dog objects.
   - <img alt="pic" src="https://i.imgur.com/8TkR0Io.jpg" width="500">



6. after declared a class called Dog, defined an object of the class called "maltese" using a new keyword.

    ```java
    // Class Declaration
    class Dog {
        // Instance Variables
        String breed;
        String size;
        int age;
        String color;

        // method 1
        public String getInfo() {
            return ("Breed is: "+breed+" Size is:"+size+" Age is:"+age+" color is: "+color);
        }
    }


    public class Execute{
        public static void main(String\[\] args) {
            Dog maltese = new Dog();
            maltese.breed="Maltese";
            maltese.size="Small";
            maltese.age=2;
            maltese.color="white";
            System.out.println(maltese.getInfo());
        }
    }

    // Output:
    // Breed is: Maltese Size is: Small Age is:2 color is: white
    ```
