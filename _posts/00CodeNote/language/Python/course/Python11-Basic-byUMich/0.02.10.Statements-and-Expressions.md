# 2.10. Statements and Expressions

A `statement` is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute.
- `assignment` statement, `while` statements, `for` statements, `if` statements, and `import` statements...

An `expression` is a combination of `literals, variable names, operators, and calls to functions`.
- Expressions need to be evaluated 估价.
- The result of evaluating an expression is a value or object.

print an expression, the interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result.
  - `len()` a built-in Python function, returns the number of characters in a string.
  - The evaluation of an expression produces a value, which is why expressions can appear on the right hand side of assignment statements.
  - A literal all by itself is a simple expression, and so is a variable.

```py
>>> print(len("hello"))
5
```


**kinds of expressions**:

  - `literal`
    - e.g., “Hello” or 3.14

  - `variable name`
    - e.g., x or len

  - `operator expression`
    - `<expression> operatorname <expression>`

  - `function call expressions`
    - `<expression>(<expressions separated by commas>)`


**Form back to from**:

The `Python interpreter` examines any line of code and parses it into components.
- For example,
- if it sees an = symbol, it will try to treat the whole line as an `assignment statement`.
- It will expect to see a `valid variable name` to the left of the =
- will parse everything right of the = as an `expression` (figure out whether the right side is a literal, a variable name, an operator expression, or a function call expression).
  - If it’s an `operator expression`, it will further try to parse the sub-expressions before and after the operator. And so on.


to evaluate an `operator expression`, `<X> operatorname <Y>`
- the Python interpreter first completely evaluates the expression Y
- then X,
- then combines the two resulting values using the operator.


to evaluate a `function call expression`, `<X>(<Y, Z>)`
- the interpreter evaluates the expression before the parentheses (looks up the name of the function).
- Then evaluate each of the expressions inside the parentheses Y Z. There may be more than one, separated by commas.
- The values of those expressions are passed as inputs to the function when the function is called.


If a `function call expression` is a sub-expression of some more complicated expression, as `square(x)` in `sub(square(y), square(x))`
- then the return value from `square(x)` is passed as an input to the `sub function`.
- tricky things
- the `square function` is called (twice) before the `sub function` is called,

```py
x = 5
y = 7
add(square(y), square(x))

//step:
add(square(y), square(x))
-add-(square(y), square(x))     # indicate that Python has looked up the name add and determined that it is a function object.
-add-(-square-(y), square(x))
-add-(-square-(7), square(x))
-add-(49, square(x))
-add-(49, -square-(x))
-add-(49, -square-(5))
-add-(49, 25)
74
```

`square(x + sub(square(y), 2 *x))`
