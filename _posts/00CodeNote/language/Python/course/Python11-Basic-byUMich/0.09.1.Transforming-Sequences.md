# 9.2 Mutability

If a type is able to change, then it is said to be mutable

```py

1. assigning

    1) list: assign list this way = assigns 2 variable name to the same list
          >>> x=[1,2,3,4,]
          >>> y=x
          y - [1,2,3,4,] - x

        one variable changes the object, both variable refect the different

          >>> y[1]=0
          y - [1,0,3,4,] - x

2. mutable/immutable

    1) list is mutable:

        append(): can make direct changes to the object.
          >>> x.append(16)
          y - [1,0,3,4,16] - x

        but append method returns none.
          >>> x=x.append(16)
          x - now point to the none
          y - [1,0,3,4,16]

    2) strings is immutable:

        replace(): can return an updated copy of the strings, cannot change the original object.
          >>> a="hola"
          >>> a.replace("l","r")
          "hora"
          >>> a
          "hola"

        if want to update the variable to point to a new strings, need to reassign.
          >>> a=a.replace("l","r")
          >>> a
          "hora"

        if 2 variable point to a string:
          >>> b=a
          >>> a=a.upper()
          a="HORA"  # one update
          b="hora"  # other remains unchanged

```

## 9.4. Objects and References

```py
a = "banana"
b = "banana"

two possible ways the Python interpreter could arrange its internal states:
    a - "banana"
    b - "banana"

1. to figure out which one:
    print(a is b)

2. check the object ID:
    print(id(a))
    print(id(b))

3. dont use "="!!!!!

    a = [81,82,83]
    b = [81,82,83]
    print(a is b)   # False
    print(a == b)   # True
```

## 9.6. Cloning Lists

cloning: to modify a list and also keep a copy of the original.
- to clone a list: `:`

```py
a = [81,82,83]

b = a[:]       # make a clone using slice
print(a == b)  # True
print(a is b)  # False

b[0] = 5
print(a)  # [81,82,83]
print(b)  # [5, 82, 83]
```

---

## extend or copy

When an object is *list*, and is concatenated with another
- using `+=`, it extends the original object.
- `item = item + object`, it makes a copy.

## 9.12. 👩‍💻 Accumulator Pattern Strategies

Accumulation 积累 Pattern

count accumulation: how many/frequently
sum accumulation: total
list accumulation: a list of
string accumulation: concatenate / join together

```py
Does the following prompt require an accumulation pattern?
- For each string in wrds, add ‘ed’ to the end of the word (to make the word past tense). Save these past tense words to a list called past_wrds. # Yes; "save... to a list"
- sum up all of the numbers in the list seat_counts. Store that number in the variable total_seat_counts. # Yes; "to sum up"
- print out each character of the string my_str on a separate line. # no
- count the number of vowels in the sentence s and assign the result to the variable num_vowels. # Yes; "code that will count"
```

## 9.13. 👩‍💻 Don’t Mutate A List That You Are Iterating Through

```py
colors = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Indigo", "Violet", "Purple", "Pink", "Brown", "Teal", "Turquois", "Peach", "Beige"]

for position in range(len(colors)):
    color = colors[position]
    print(color)
    if color[0] in ["P", "B", "T"]:
        del colors[position]             # error
        # as we delete content from the list, the list becomes shorter.

print(colors)
```
