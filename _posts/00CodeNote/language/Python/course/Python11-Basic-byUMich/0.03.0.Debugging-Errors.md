# 3.1. Introduction to Debugging

“The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do.”  — Andrew Singer

# 3.2.1. How to Avoid Debugging
it is largely avoidable – if you work carefully.

1. Understand the Problem

2. Start Small

3. Keep Improving. keep adding small pieces of the program one at a time, it is much easier to figure out what went wrong. (This of course means you must be able to recognize if there is an error. And that is done through testing.)

This notion of `Get something working and keep improving it` is a mantra that you can repeat throughout your career as a programmer.

# 3.3. 👩‍💻 Beginning tips for Debugging
Debugging a program is a different way of thinking than writing a program. The process of debugging is much more like being a detective.

1. Everyone is a suspect (Except Python)! blame Python should be your last resort. Python is probably not the problem.

2. Check your assumptions.

3. Find clues. This is the biggest job of the detective and right now there are two important kinds of clues for you to understand.
  - Error Messages
  - Print Statements


Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: `syntax errors, runtime errors, and semantic errors`.

- Attempting to divide by 0.
  - **<font color=blur> Runtime errors </font>**
  - Python cannot reliably tell if you are trying to divide by 0 until it is executing your program (e.g., you might be asking the user for a value and then dividing by that value—you cannot know what value the user will enter before you run the program).

- Forgetting a semi-colon at the end of a statement where one is required.
  - **<font color=blur> Syntax errors </font>**
  - no correct output because *the code can not be processed by the compiler or interpreter*. This would be considered a syntax error.

- Forgetting to divide by 100 when printing a percentage amount.
  - **<font color=blur> semantic errors </font>**
  - produce the wrong answer because the programmer implemented the solution incorrectly. This is a semantic error.

# 3.4. Syntax errors
Python can only execute a program if the program is `syntactically 在语句构成上 correct`; otherwise, the process fails and returns an error message.

Syntax refers to `the structure` of a program and `the rules` about that structure.

If there is a single syntax error anywhere in your program, Python will display an error message and quit. You will not be able to complete the execution of your program.


`The compiler/interpreter` typically finds syntax errors
- The compiler and / or interpreter is a computer program that determines if your program is written in a way that can be translated into machine language for execution.



# 3.5. Runtime Errors
runtime error:
- the error does not appear until you run the program.
- are also called exceptions because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.

If an instruction is illegal to perform at that point in the execution, `the interpreter` will stop with a message describing the exception.


# 3.6. Semantic 语义的 Errors
semantic error:
- run successfully in the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages, but, program will not do the right thing. It will do something else.
- It will do what you told it to do.
- The meaning of the program (its semantics) is wrong. Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure out what it is doing.


# 3.7. 👩‍💻 Error Messages

## 3.7.1. SyntaxError
`Syntaxerrors` happen when you make an error in the syntax of your program. Syntax errors are like making grammatical errors in writing.

`TokenError: EOF in multi-line statement`
- Python got to the end of file (EOF) while it was still looking for something.

## 3.7.2. TypeError

`TypeErrors` occur when you you try to combine two objects that are not compatible.

## 3.7.3. NameError
`Nameerrors` almost always mean that you have used a variable before it has a value. Often NameErrors are simply caused by typos in your code.

`NameError: name 'current_time_str' is not defined on line 4.`

## 3.7.4. ValueError
`Valueerrors` occur when you pass a parameter to a function and the function is expecting a certain limitations on the values, and the value passed is not compatible. We can illustrate that with this particular program in two different ways.


## UnboundLocalError

全局变量(UnboundLocalError: local variable referenced before assignment)

```py

    count = 0
    # solution:
    # global count
    # declare 'count' used in this function is the global one
    def function():
        count = count + 1
        print(count)

Then we get: UnboundLocalError: local variable 'count' referenced before assignment

The reason this happens is because as soon as you write to a variable, that variable is automatically local to the function.


2.
    def test (int, boo=True, dict1={2:3, 4:5, 6:8}):
        # solution:
        # a=False
        if boo==True:
            if int in dict1:
                a=dict1[int]
            else:
                a=boolean(0)
        return a

```
