# 2.11. Order of Operations

When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of evaluation depends on the `rules of precedence` 优先权.

Python follows the same precedence rules for its mathematical operators that mathematics does.

1. Parentheses

2. Exponentiation `**` so 3*1**3 is 3 and not 27.

3. Multiplication and both division operators. `* / //  %`

4. Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from `left-to-right`. In algebra we say they are left-associative.
  - 6-3+2, the subtraction happens first, yielding 3.


Note
an exception to the left-to-right left-associative rule: the exponentiation operator `**`.
- right to the left !!!


```py
>>> print(2 ** 3 ** 2)
512
# the right-most ** operator gets done first!

>>> print((2 ** 3) ** 2)
64
# use parentheses to force the order you want!

16 - 2 * 5 // 3 + 1
//step:
16 - 2 * 5 // 3 + 1
16 - 10 // 3 + 1
16 - 3 + 1
13 + 1
14

```
