## 23.5. `zip(lst1, lst2)` --> list of tuples

[toc]

## Intro

pairwise

One common pattern with lists, besides accumulation, is to step through a pair of lists (or several lists), doing something with all of the first items, then something with all of the second items, and so on.

The `zip` function: takes multiple lists and turns them into a `list of tuples` (actually, an iterator, but they work like lists for most practical purposes),
- pairing up all the first items as one tuple, all the second items as a tuple, and so on.
- Then iterate through those tuples, and perform some operation on all the first items, all the second items, and so on.

better to `list()` the zip result


```py

1. sum the num in the same index.

    L1 = [3, 4, 5]
    L2 = [1, 2, 3]
    L3 = []

    # manual accumulation:
    for i in range(len(L1)):
        L3.append(L1[i] + L2[i])
    print(L3)      # [4, 6, 8]

    # Zip
    L4 = list(zip(L1, L2))
    for (x1, x2) in L4:
        L3.append(x1+x2)

    # list comprehension
    L3 = map(lambda x: x[0] + x[1], zip(L1, L2))

    L3 = [x1 + x2 for (x1, x2) in list(zip(L1, L2))]


3.

    L1 = [1, 5, 2, 16, 32, 3, 54, 8, 100]
    L2 = [1, 3, 10, 2, 42, 2, 3, 4, 3]

    L3 =  [x1 + x2 for (x1,x2) in zip(L1,L2) if x1>10 and x2<5]

```

## example:

1. Hangman

```py

// word from dictionary, compare to see if its the right word.

1.

    def possible(word, blanked, guess_made):
        if len(word) != len(blanked):    # 是否字数相同
            return False
        for i in range(len(word)):
            bc=blanked[i]
            wc=word[i]
            if bc=="_" and wc in guess_made:
                return False
            elif bc=="_" and bc!=wc:
                return False
        return True

    print(possible("wonderwall", "_on__r__ll","otnqurl"))  # True
    print(possible("wonderwall", "_on__r__ll","wotnqurl")) # False


2. update.

    def compatible_char(wc, bc, guess_made):
        if bc=="_" and wc in guess_made:
            return False
        elif bc=="_" and bc!=wc:
            return False
        else:
            return True

    def possible(word, blanked, guess_made):
        if len(word) != len(blanked):    # 是否字数相同
            return False
#      for i in range(len(word)):
#          bc=blanked[i]
#          wc=word[i]
        for (bc, wc) in zip(blanked, word)
            if not compatible_char(wc, bc, guess_made):
              return False
        return True
```
