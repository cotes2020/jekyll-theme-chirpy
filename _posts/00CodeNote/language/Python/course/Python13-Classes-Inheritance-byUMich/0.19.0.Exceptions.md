# 19. Exceptions

## 19.1. What is an exception?
An exception is a signal that a condition has occurred that can’t be easily handled using the normal flow-of-control of a Python program. Exceptions are often defined as being “errors” but this is not always the case. All errors in Python are dealt with using exceptions, but not all exceptions are errors.

## 19.2. Exception Handling Flow-of-control

In normal operation Python executes statements sequentially, one after the other.

For three constructs, `if-statements`, `loops` and `function invocations`, this sequential execution is interrupted.
- For if-statements, only one of several statement blocks is executed and then flow-of-control jumps to the first statement after the if-statement.
- For loops, when the end of the loop is reached, flow-of-control jumps back to the start of the loop, and a test is used to determine if the loop needs to execute again. If the loop is finished, flow-of-control jumps to the first statement after the loop.
- For function invocations, flow-of-control jumps to the first statement in the called function, the function is executed, and the flow-of-control jumps back to the next statement after the function call.


Exceptions provide us with way to have a non-sequential point where we can handle something out of the ordinary (exceptional).

## 19.2.1. Raising and Catching Errors

With try/except, the python interpreter:
- Try to execute a block of code, the `“try”` clause.
  - If the whole block of code executes without any run-time errors
    - carry on with the rest of the program after the `try/except statement`.
  - If a `run-time error` does occur during execution of the block of code:
    - skip the rest of that block of code (but don’t exit the whole program)
    - execute a block of code in the “except” clause
    - then carry on with the rest of the program after the try/except statement

```py
    try:
       <try clause code block>
    except <ErrorType>:
       <exception handler code block>
```

when the error is encountered
- the `rest of the try block` is skipped
- the `exception block` is executed.
- When the except block is done, it continues on with the next line of code that’s outdented to the same level as the try.

```py

1.

    try:
        items = ['a', 'b']
        third = items[3]
        print("This won't print")
    except Exception:
        print("got an error")

    print("continuing")
    #
    got an error
    continuing

2. 2 errors, only executing one.
   If we catch only IndexEror, and we actually have a divide by zero error, the program does stop executing.

    try:
        items = ['a', 'b']
        third = items[2]
        print("This won't print")
    except IndexError, e:
        print("error 1")
        print(e)

    print("continuing")

    try:
        x = 5
        y = x/0
        print("This won't print, either")
    except IndexError:
        print("error 2")


    print("continuing again")
    #
    error 1
    IndexError: list index out of range on line 3
    continuing
    # ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero on line 14



3. print out the error.
   "except Exception, e"

    try:
        items = ['a', 'b']
        third = items[2]
        print("This won't print")
    except Exception, e:
        print("got an error")
        print(e)

    print("continuing")
    #
    got an error
    IndexError: list index out of range on line 3
    continuing


4. the for loop does not work
   - but Add a try/except clause, the code runs without an errors.

    students = [('Timmy', 95, 'Will pass'), ('Martha', 70), ('Betty', 82, 'Will pass'), ('Stewart', 50, 'Will not pass'), ('Ashley', 68), ('Natalie', 99, 'Will pass'), ('Archie', 71), ('Carl', 45, 'Will not pass')]

    passing = {'Will pass': 0, 'Will not pass': 0}

    for tup in students:
        try:
            if tup[2] == 'Will pass':
                passing['Will pass'] += 1
            elif tup[2] == 'Will not pass':
                passing['Will not pass'] += 1
        except Exception, e:
            print("got an error")
            print(e)
            print(tup)

    # got an error
    got an error
    IndexError: tuple index out of range on line 8
    ('Martha', 70)
    got an error
    IndexError: tuple index out of range on line 8
    ('Ashley', 68)
    got an error
    IndexError: tuple index out of range on line 8
    ('Archie', 71)


    nums = [5, 9, '4', 3, 2, 1, 6, 5, '7', 4, 3, 2, 6, 7, 8, '0', 3, 4, 0, 6, 5, '3', 5, 6, 7, 8, '3', '1', 5, 6, 7, 9, 3, 2, 5, 6, '9', 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
    plus_four = []

    for num in nums:
        try:
            plus_four.append(num+4)
        except Exception:
            plus_four.append("Error")
    #
    "[9, 13, 'Error', 7, 6, 5, 10, 9, 'Error', 8, 7, 6, 10, 11, 12, 'Error', 7, 8, 4, 10, 9, 'Error', 9, 10, 11, 12, 'Error', 'Error', 9, 10, 11, 13, 7, 6, 9, 10, 'Error', 6, 7, 8, 9, 5]"
```


## 19.3. 👩‍💻 When to use try/except

The reason to use try/except is when you have a code block to execute that will sometimes run correctly and sometimes not, depending on conditions you can’t foresee at the time you’re writing the code.

For example, when you are running code that fetches data from a website, you may run the code when you don’t have a network connection or when the external website is temporarily not responding. If your program can still do something useful in those situations, you would like to handle the exception and have the rest of your code execute.


```py

1. fetched some nested data from a website into a dictionary d. When you try to extract specific elements, some may be missing: d may not include a particular key

example: particular key potentially not being present, write an "if..else" check to take care of it.

if somekey in d:
    # it's there; extract the data
    extract_data(d)
else:
    skip_this_one(d)


However, when extracting lots of different data, can wrap all the data extraction in a try/except.

try:
    extract_data(d)
except:
    skip_this_one(d)
```

It’s considered poor practice to catch all exceptions this way.
Instead, python provides a mechanism to specify just certain kinds of exceptions that you’ll catch
(example, just catching exceptions of type KeyError, which happens when a key is missing from a dictionary.

```py
try:
    extract_data(d)
except KeyError:
    skip_this_one(d)
```


## 19.4. Standard Exceptions

## Exceptions

### Handling the ZeroDivisionError Exception

```py
try:
    print(5/0)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
# You can't divide by zero!
```

### Using Exceptions to Prevent Crashes

```py
print("two numbers > divide them:")
print("Enter 'q' to quit.")

while True:
    first_number = input("\nFirst number: ")
    if first_number == 'q':
        break
    second_number = input("Second number: ")
    if second_number == 'q':
        break

    # answer = int(first_number) / int(second_number)
    # print(answer)

    try:
        answer = int(first_number) / int(second_number)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("You can't divide by 0!")
    else:
        print(answer)
```

### Handling the FileNotFoundError Exception

```py
filename = 'alice.txt'
try:
    with open(filename, encoding='utf-8') as f:
        contents = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Sorry, the file {filename} does not exist.")

# Sorry, the file alice.txt does not exist.
```

### Working with Multiple Files

```py
def count_words(filename):
    # try:
    #     with open(filename, encoding='utf-8') as f:
    #         contents = f.read()
    # except FileNotFoundError:
    #     print(f"Sorry, the file {filename} does not exist.")
    # else:
    #     words = contents.split()
    #     num_words = len(words)
    #     print(f"The file {filename} has about {num_words} words.")

# filename = 'alice.txt'
# count_words(filename)

filenames = ['alice.txt', 'siddhartha.txt', 'moby_dick.txt', 'little_women.txt']
for filename in filenames:
    count_words(filename)
```

### Failing Silently

```py
# def count_words(filename):
#     try:
#         --snip--
#     except FileNotFoundError:
        pass
#    else: --snip--
```

## example


```py

1. Add a try/except clause so the code runs without errors. If a blog post didn’t get any likes, a ‘Likes’ key should be added to that dictionary with a value of 0.

    blog_posts = [{'Photos': 3, 'Likes': 21, 'Comments': 2}, {'Likes': 13, 'Comments': 2, 'Shares': 1}, {'Photos': 5, 'Likes': 33, 'Comments': 8, 'Shares': 3}, {'Comments': 4, 'Shares': 2}, {'Photos': 8, 'Comments': 1, 'Shares': 1}, {'Photos': 3, 'Likes': 19, 'Comments': 3}]

    total_likes = 0

    for post in blog_posts:
        #try:
            total_likes = total_likes + post['Likes']
        #except Exception, e:
        #    print(post)
        #    post['Likes']=0
        #    print(e)


2. The code below assigns the 5th letter of each word in food to the new list fifth. However, the code currently produces errors. Insert a try/except clause that will allow the code to run and produce of list of the 5th letter in each word. If the word is not long enough, it should not print anything out. Note: The pass statement is a null operation; nothing will happen when it executes.

    food = ["chocolate", "chicken", "corn", "sandwich", "soup", "potatoes", "beef", "lox", "lemonade"]
    fifth = []

    for x in food:
        #try:
            fifth.append(x[4])
        #    print(fifth)
        #except:
        #    a=0


3. Correctly add try/except clause in the code so that it will correctly populate the list, country_gold, with either the number of golds won or the string “Did not get gold”.

    gold = {"US":46, "Fiji":1, "Great Britain":27, "Cuba":5, "Thailand":2, "China":26, "France":10}
    country = ["Fiji", "Chile", "Mexico", "France", "Norway", "US"]
    country_gold = []

    for x in country:
        #try:
            country_gold.append(gold[x])
        #except:
            country_gold.append("Did not get gold")


4. Insert a try/except so that the code passes.

    di = [{"Puppies": 17, 'Kittens': 9, "Birds": 23, 'Fish': 90, "Hamsters": 49}, {"Puppies": 23, "Birds": 29, "Fish": 20, "Mice": 20, "Snakes": 7}, {"Fish": 203, "Hamsters": 93, "Snakes": 25, "Kittens": 89}, {"Birds": 20, "Puppies": 90, "Snakes": 21, "Fish": 10, "Kittens": 67}]
    total = 0

    for diction in di:
        #try:
            total = total + diction['Puppies']
        #except:
        #    a=0
    print("Total number of puppies:", total)


5. The list, numb, contains integers. Write code that populates the list remainder with the remainder of 36 divided by each number in numb.

    numb = [6, 0, 36, 8, 2, 36, 0, 12, 60, 0, 45, 0, 3, 23]
    remainder = []

    for num in numb:
        try:
            rnum=36%num
            remainder.append(rnum)
        except:
            remainder.append('Error')
    print(remainder)
    #
    [0, 'Error', 0, 4, 0, 0, 'Error', 0, 36, 'Error', 36, 'Error', 0, 13]


6. If the key is not there, initialize it in the dictionary and set the value to zero.

    di = [{"Puppies": 17, 'Kittens': 9, "Birds": 23, 'Fish': 90, "Hamsters": 49}, {"Puppies": 23, "Birds": 29, "Fish": 20, "Mice": 20, "Snakes": 7}, {"Fish": 203, "Hamsters": 93, "Snakes": 25, "Kittens": 89}, {"Birds": 20, "Puppies": 90, "Snakes": 21, "Fish": 10, "Kittens": 67}]
    total = 0
    for diction in di:
        try:
            total = total + diction['Puppies']
        except:
            diction['Puppies']=0
    print("Total number of puppies:", total)
```
