It was exciting to moderate two sessions in Seattle, one on cyber security to cover for the initially planned presenter and the other on “IT Transformation and CIOs,” as part of my original session. Interacting with over twenty leaders in the field was very informative. Thank you, NCS Madison, for allowing me to moderate the sessions.
