I'm going to explain how the website you're currently on was created.

I wanted to have a place where I could write about my projects and keep track of them. Even though I've created several websites in the past, this one was incredibly simple: all I needed was a blog, or some static pages for my new posts, and a way to navigate them. 

That's why I chose Jekyll to create the website and Github Pages to host it. I was familiar with these tools from a previous job where I built another site using the same technologies.

## Jekyll : A static site generator
There are many similar tools available now, but I continue to use **Jekyll** due to its simplicity and support. 
Jekyll is an open-source static site generator written in Ruby. It renders Markdown and Liquid templates and generates a complete static website that can be served by any web server.

That means I can quickly add new content by simply creating a new Mardown text file.

## Github Pages : A free hosting service
**GitHub Pages** offers free hosting of a Jekyll website in one of your repositories. The website is then published and can be found at *username.github.io* or under your own domain name. 

As you've probably noticed, I went with the latter option because I already own the beniserv.fr domain for my home server and other services.

## Chirpy : A stunning Jekyll theme
I could have built the site from scratch, but I'm not a good designer, and it would have taken months of effort. I didn't want to spend so much time creating an average-looking blog. 

So I began looking for an existing theme and fell in love with the **Chirpy** theme by **Cotes Chung**. It was exactly what I needed and expected. 
It had the majority of the functionalities needed for a good blog (and even more): posts, tags, categories, a search function, an archive, etc.

And because the theme is so well-designed, it only takes a few minutes to get started.

## Multi-language : Implementing Polyglot
The only issue I had with this theme was a lack of multilingual support. 

It is essential for me to be able to write posts in both English and French. And I wanted to make it easy for the reader to switch between the two languages.

Hopefully, there is a Jekyll plugin called **Polyglot**. So I integrated it into my site after making some theme changes and adding a language selector to the side menu.

Eventually, I would clean up my code, and create a Pull Request to the Chirpy theme with my changes, as I'm sure multi-language support could be interesting.
