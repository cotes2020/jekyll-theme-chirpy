It is time to talk about one my proudest achievement : **Culturion**.

{% include embed/youtube.html id='7KrYA6vUp8Q' %}

I wanted to reuse my acquired knowledge during the development of my first Android native application : Moovic. But this time, it would be more polished and ambitious.

The first step was to find a game idea, still realizable in Android Studio, and like Moovic, about general culture. That is how I found the perfect subject : a quiz on different aspects of French culture.

So I started to develop the application in the end of 2020, before putting the project on hold after being discouraged by my lack of inspiration for the UI. It was only 6 months later, during the summer, that I regained some motivation thanks to one idea. 
The concept was to display a blank map of France, and let the player fill it in as he answers correctly. For example, by guessing which city the photo was taken in, the location of the city is revealed on the map.

Then I extended this concept to other aspects of France : department number, gastronomic dish, and hometown of celebrities. I worked on this for several months, spending time developing the application but also gathering all the needed data (city photos, culinary specialties, ...). All this data then had to be added to a MySQL database.

I also thought of a name and found 'Culturion' : the contraction of '*Culture*' and '*Region*' because the game is based on cultural knowledge and also divided by French region.

Once the game was in a playable state, I asked my family and friends to try it. Their feedback was quite positive, and I used it to correct bugs and to improve some features.
Finally, I published it publicly to the Play Store and started a marketing campaign. The result exceeded my expectations because I'm proud to say it's been downloaded by over 15,000 people !

Sadly, the application is not available anymore on the Play Store because of the outdated Android SDK, but it is a project I will never forget !
