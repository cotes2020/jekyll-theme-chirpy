## Basic Data Concepts

### Data Source

#### Field

Qualitative fields (Dimensions):

- Describes or categorizes data
- Tells you what, when, or who
- Slices the quantitative data

Quantitative fields (Measures):

- Numerical data
- Provides the measurement for qualitative category
- Can be used in calculations

Fields in Tableau

- When Tableau connected to this data set, it assigned the fields to either **Dimensions** or **Measures**.

- The qualitative fields that describe categories of data are in the top part of the pane, under **Dimensions**.
- The quantitative fields that measure categories of data are in the bottom part of the pane, under **Measures**.


Row level record: row of data is more detailed, or, granular, than in the first data set.

Data granularity: refers to the level of detail for a piece of data

### Common Chart Types

**Visual analytics** leverages our `pre‑attentive` attributes – visual cues humans process automatically with sensory memory.

Line — View trends in data over time.
Examples:  Stock price change over a five-year period or website page views during a month.

Bar — Compare data across categories.
Examples: Volume of shirts in different sizes, or percent of spending by department.

Heat Map — Show the relationship between two factors.
Examples: Segment analysis of target market, or sales leads by individual rep.

Highlight Table — Shows detailed information on heat maps.
Examples: The percent of a market for different segments, or sales numbers in a  region.

Treemap — Show hierarchical data as a proportion of a whole.
Examples: Storage usage across computer machines, comparing fiscal budgets between years.

Gantt — Show duration over time.
Examples: Project timeline, duration of a machine’s use, availability of players on a team.

Bullet — Evaluate performance of a metric against a goal.
Examples: Sales quota assessment,  performance spectrum (great/good/poor).

Scatterplot — Investigate relationships between quantitative values.
Examples: Male versus female likelihood of having lung cancer at different ages, or technology early adopters’ and laggards’ purchase patterns of smart phones.

- Use scatter plots to determine correlation between two measures.
- Correlation refers to a relationship between two or more things.

Histogram — Understand the distribution of your data.
Examples: Number of customers by company size, student performance on an exam, frequency of a product defect.

Symbol maps — Use for totals rather than rates. Be careful, as small differences will be hard to see.
Examples: Number of customers in different geographies.

![](../../../assets/img/2020-11-11-Tableau-20251016143235.png)

Area maps — Use for rates rather than totals. Use sensible base geography. Examples: Rates of internet-usage in certain geographies, house prices in different neighborhoods.

Box-and-Whisker — Show the distribution of a set of the data.
Examples: Understanding your data at a glance, seeing how data is skewed towards one end, identifying outliers in your data.
