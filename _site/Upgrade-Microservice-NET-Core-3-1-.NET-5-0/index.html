It also is the first step of a unified .NET platform and is the first version of Microsofts new release cycle. From now on, Microsoft will release a new version of .NET every November. .NET 6.0 will be released in November 2021, .NET 7.0 in November 2022, and so on. Today, I want to show how to upgrade a microservice and its build pipeline from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 5.0. You can find the code of this demo on Github. System Requirements for .NET 5.0 To use .NET 5.0 you have to install the .NET 5.0 SDK from the dotnet download page and Visual Studio 16.8 or later. Uprgrade from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 5.0 To upgrade your solution to .NET 5.0, you have to update the TargetFramework in every .csproj file of your solution. Replace 1 &lt;TargetFramework&gt;netcoreapp3.1&lt;/TargetFramework&gt; with 1 &lt;TargetFramework&gt;net5.0&lt;/TargetFramework&gt; Instead of updating all project files and next year updating them again, I created a new file called common.props in the root folder of the solution. This file contains the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt; &lt;Project xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003&quot;&gt; &lt;PropertyGroup&gt; &lt;DefaultTargetFramework&gt;net5.0&lt;/DefaultTargetFramework&gt; &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt; &lt;PropertyGroup Label=&quot;C#&quot;&gt; &lt;LangVersion&gt;latest&lt;/LangVersion&gt; &lt;TargetLatestRuntimePatch&gt;true&lt;/TargetLatestRuntimePatch&gt; &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt; &lt;/Project&gt; This file defines the C# version I am using and sets DefaultTargetFramework to net5.0. Additionally, I have a Directory.Build.props file with the following content: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt; &lt;Project xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003&quot;&gt; &lt;ImportGroup Condition=&quot; &#39;$(MSBuildProjectExtension)&#39; == &#39;.csproj&#39; &quot;&gt; &lt;Import Project=&quot;.\file-version.props&quot; /&gt; &lt;Import Project=&quot;.\common.props&quot; /&gt; &lt;/ImportGroup&gt; &lt;/Project&gt; This file links the common.props file to the .csproj files. The file-version file is not needed now and I will talk about it in a later post. After setting this up, I can use this variable in my project files and can update with it all my projects with one change in a single file. Update the TargetFramework of all your .csproj files with the following code: 1 &lt;TargetFramework&gt;$(DefaultTargetFramework)&lt;/TargetFramework&gt; After updating all project files, update all Nuget packages of your solution. You can do this by right-clicking your solution –&gt; Manage Nuget Packages for Solution… Update your Nuget packages That’s it. Your solution is updated to .NET 5.0. Build the solution to check that you have no errors. Build the solution Additionally, run all your tests to make sure your code still works. Run all unit tests Lastly, I update the path to the XML comments in the CustomerApi.csproj file with the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 &lt;PropertyGroup Condition=&quot;&#39;$(Configuration)|$(Platform)&#39;==&#39;Debug|AnyCPU&#39;&quot;&gt; &lt;DocumentationFile&gt;obj\Release\net5.0\CustomerApi.xml&lt;/DocumentationFile&gt; &lt;NoWarn&gt;1701;1702;1591&lt;/NoWarn&gt; &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt; &lt;PropertyGroup Condition=&quot;&#39;$(Configuration)|$(Platform)&#39;==&#39;Release|AnyCPU&#39;&quot;&gt; &lt;DocumentationFile&gt;obj\Release\net5.0\CustomerApi.xml&lt;/DocumentationFile&gt; &lt;NoWarn&gt;1701;1702;1591&lt;/NoWarn&gt; &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt; Update CI pipeline There are no changes required in the CI pipeline because the solution is built-in Docker. Therefore, I have to update the Dockerfile. Replace the following two lines: 1 2 FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.1-buster-slim AS base FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1-buster AS build with 1 2 FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0 AS base FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build This tells Docker to use the new .NET 5.0 images to build and run the application. Additionally, I have to copy the .props files into my Docker image with the following code inside the Dockerfile: 1 COPY [&quot;*.props&quot;, &quot;./&quot;] Check in your changes and the build in Azure DevOps will run successfully. The .NET 5.0 build was successful Conclusion Today, I showed how easy it can be to upgrade .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 5.0. To upgrade was so easy because I kept my solution up to date and because microservices are small solutions that are way easier to upgrade than big monolithic applications. The whole upgrade for both my microservices took around 10 minutes. I know that a real-world microservice will have more code than mine but nevertheless, it is quite easy to update it. If you are coming from .NET Core 2.x or even .NET 4.x, the upgrade might be harder.

To upgrade was so easy because I kept my solution up to date and because microservices are small solutions that are way easier to upgrade than big monolithic applications. The whole upgrade for both my microservices took around 10 minutes. I know that a real-world microservice will have more code than mine but nevertheless, it is quite easy to update it. If you are coming from .NET Core 2.x or even .NET 4.x, the upgrade might be harder.</p><p>You can find the code of this demo on <a href="https://github.com/WolfgangOfner/MicroserviceDemo">Github</a>.</p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/asp.net/'>ASP.NET</a>, <a href='/categories/docker/'>Docker</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/azure-devops/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration">Azure DevOps</a> <a href="/tags/ci/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration">CI</a> <a href="/tags/docker/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration">docker</a> <a href="/tags/xunit/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration">xUnit</a> <a href="/tags/net-5.0/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration">NET 5.0</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Upgrade a Microservice from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 5.0 - Programming With Wolfgang&url=http://0.0.0.0:4000/Upgrade-Microservice-NET-Core-3-1-.NET-5-0/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Twitter" target="_blank"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Upgrade a Microservice from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 5.0 - Programming With Wolfgang&u=http://0.0.0.0:4000/Upgrade-Microservice-NET-Core-3-1-.NET-5-0/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Facebook" target="_blank"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-facebook-square"></i> </a> <a href="https://telegram.me/share?text=Upgrade a Microservice from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 5.0 - Programming With Wolfgang&url=http://0.0.0.0:4000/Upgrade-Microservice-NET-Core-3-1-.NET-5-0/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Telegram" target="_blank"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-telegram"></i> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=http://0.0.0.0:4000/Upgrade-Microservice-NET-Core-3-1-.NET-5-0/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Linkedin" target="_blank"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-linkedin"></i> </a> <i class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" onclick="copyLink()" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link"></i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted topbar-down"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"><h3 data-toc-skip>Recent Update</h3><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/we-moved-to-jekyll/">We moved to Jekyll</a><li><a href="/run-xUnit-inside-docker-during-ci-build/">Run xUnit Tests inside Docker during an Azure DevOps CI Build</a><li><a href="/build-docker-azure-devops-ci-pipeline/">Build Docker in an Azure DevOps CI Pipeline</a><li><a href="/run-the-ci-pipeline-during-pull-request/">Run the CI Pipeline during a Pull Request</a><li><a href="/run-tests-inside-docker-during-ci/">Run Tests inside Docker during CI</a></ul></div><div id="access-tags"><h3 data-toc-skip>Trending Tags</h3><div class="d-flex flex-wrap mt-3 mb-1 mr-3"> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/xunit/">xUnit</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/mediatr/">MediatR</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/cqrs/">CQRS</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/docker-compose/">docker compose</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/swagger/">Swagger</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/scrum/">Scrum</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/ci/">CI</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/agile/">Agile</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/rabbitmq/">RabbitMQ</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/mvc/">MVC</a></div></div></div><div id="toc-wrapper" class="pl-0 pr-4 mb-5"><h3 data-toc-skip class="pl-3 pt-2 mb-2">Contents</h3><nav id="toc" data-toggle="toc"></nav></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-8"><div id="post-extend-wrapper" class="pl-1 pr-1 pl-sm-2 pr-sm-2 pl-md-4 pr-md-4"><div id="related-posts" class="mt-5 mb-2 mb-sm-4"><h3 class="pt-2 mt-1 mb-4 ml-1" data-toc-skip>Further Reading</h3><div class="card-deck mb-4"><div class="card"> <a href="/run-xUnit-inside-docker-during-ci-build/"><div class="card-body"> <span class="timeago small" > Nov 9 <i class="unloaded">2020-11-09T00:00:00+01:00</i> </span><h3 class="pt-0 mt-1 mb-3" data-toc-skip>Run xUnit Tests inside Docker during an Azure DevOps CI Build</h3><div class="text-muted small"><p> Running your build inside a Docker container has many advantages like platform independence and better testability for developers.
