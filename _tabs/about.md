I'm a software developer at a semiconductor company, focused on creating scalable and efficient hardware and software solutions.

I have a strong interest in Product development, Product Management, Computer Vision, and operational fields like DevOps and MLOps, with a particular focus on SaaS environments.

I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities for growth in these areas.

I also have a deep fascination with Indian history and culture, a passion for learning new languages, and a love for sports like cricket and football.
