📢 A 3-Day Workshop on Language Models for Social Sciences! 🚀

As artificial intelligence and language models continue to revolutionize various sectors, we are thrilled to invite early career social scientists to our 3-day workshop, where we aim to bridge the gap and unlock the transformative potential of language models in the realm of social sciences!

🗓️ Workshop Program:
📅 Day 1: Fundamentals of Large Language Models
9:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Lecture
During this session, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts underlying language models. We'll explore the evolutionary journey from rule-based systems to modern Transformers-based models, which are the state-of-the-art technology in natural language processing (NLP).

12:00 PM - 1:00 PM: Lunch Break

1:00 PM - 4:00 PM: Coding Tutorial: Introduction to Transformer Models
Get hands-on experience implementing and utilizing Transformer models for various NLP tasks in social sciences. Practical exercises and coding examples will be provided.

📅 Day 2: Model Interpretation and Debiasing
9:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Lecture
Learn techniques for interpreting language model outputs, including attention visualization and probing. We'll also address model bias and explore strategies to detect and mitigate bias in language models, ensuring unbiased social science research.

12:00 PM - 1:00 PM: Lunch Break

1:00 PM - 4:00 PM: Coding Tutorial: Interpreting and Debiasing Language Models
Apply the concepts covered in the lecture to interpret and debias language models. Hands-on experience with various interpretation techniques and practical exercises will be provided.

📅 Day 3: Recent Developments: Large Language Models and Alignment
9:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Lecture
Discover recent advancements in language models, including large-scale models and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Understand the creation process of InstructGPT models, like the popular ChatGPT, and explore their applications in social science research.

12:00 PM - 1:00 PM: Lunch Break

1:00 PM - 4:00 PM: Coding Tutorial: Advanced Techniques with Large Language Models and Alignment
Explore advanced techniques with large language models and RLHF. Gain hands-on experience with fine-tuning large-scale models using RLHF methods on your own research questions and datasets.

4:00 PM - 6 PM: Coding Challenge and Awards Ceremony 🏆
Team up to tackle a challenging research problem! Showcase your creativity, efficiency, and innovation in solving the task using language models. Prizes will be awarded for the most outstanding solutions and innovations. This is your chance to test your skills, build networks, and delve deep into the thrilling world of language models!
