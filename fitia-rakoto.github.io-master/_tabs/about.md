## Purpose and Role of the Awarded Project
The primary objective of this proposal is to establish a comprehensive research data repository for data generated by the AIM-AHEAD project, which focuses on addressing health disparities in medical research and treatment. This collaborative effort involves UTHealth, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, and aims to merge various medical data sources to develop a robust infrastructure for data storage, management, and sharing.
