I studied Software architecture and design in Austria and Canada. While studying I was working for the Austrian Federal Computing Center as .Net Software Engineer. After finishing my Masters, I moved to  Switzerland and work there as Solution Architect. In various projects, I learned the advantages of clean code and TDD and focused on ASP.NET MVC, Azure and software architecture. Today, I am working for 4tecture as a Senior Consultant for Azure, DevOps and .NET solutions at 4tecture GmbH. I am mostly passionate about software architecture, cloud technologies and DevOps.

## My goals

I made this website as a kind of knowledge base for myself. When I read about something interesting or learn anything I will write about it. I think when writing about a topic you concentrate more and therefore have better study results. The second reason why I made this website is, that I love teaching and I hope that people find their way on here and can benefit from my posts.
